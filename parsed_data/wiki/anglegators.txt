Gameplay
As fruit spawns and move toward the gator, the player must use the arrow keys to open or close the gator's mouth. Points will be awarded or removed based on the angle of the gator's mouth opening. Maximum points will be awarded for each fruit if the angle of the gator's mouth matches the required angle of the fruit. If a player misses a fruit, the alligator 'loses a tooth', to act a typical life counter.
