Sucrose 0.83.4 Release Notes
Announcement
Since, this date is Feature, API, String freeze everyone was busy getting their features in.
From a user point of view we want to highlight the following:
Naming alert on journal entry creation
The journal's search and browsing capabilities are less useful if all entries are named the same regardless of their actual content or
meaning to the user. That is why an alert has been added that encourage the user to set the title and other properties, like available in the journal detail view, of a newly created journal entry. This alert is only shown on the creation of a new journal entry, not on resume.
Display recent activities in the home view
In order to make easier to continue past work, the home view will display recent entries in the activity palettes.
You can decide if you want the activity icons to represent the last journal entry with a new setting in the favourites view palette:
Journal
Tomeu Vizoso has been doing a wonderful work of bringing the journal implementation closer to its design.The Object chooser can now be filtered by data type.
A favourite filter has been added to the journal toolbar to give a better way of marking entries as 'important'. More regression fixes went into the support of removable devices after moving from maintaining an index file on the device to the use of POSIX calls.
New ColorToolButton Widget
Benjamin Berg added a new ColorToolButton widget. It is already in use in the Write activity to select a colour for the text.
Control Panel
The 'About my XO' section has been renamed to 'About my Computer' to reflect the use of Sugar on non-XO hardware. Morgan Collett added the possibility to change the jabber server without restarting Sugar.
Autoconnect to Access Point
NetworkManager does autoconnect on Sugar startup to the last Access Point you were connected successfully to.
Logout Option
Sayamindu Dasgupta added a logout option to the xomenu. Eben Eliason added the accessibility of the xomenu to the groups and mesh view and to the friends tray in the frame.
New Logic for the devices positions
The logic to position the frame devices has been reworked. Plug in your devices and try it out.
[500 external devices eg. USB drive]
[400 3rd party devices eg. speech]
[300 transient connection devices eg. AP]
[200 transient devices eg. camera]
[100 static devices eg. battery]
Table of Content Support in Read
The Read activity now shows the Table of Content for PDF files which support this feature. This eases navigation of large PDF files considerably.
Acknowledgment
A big thanks goes to all the translators, that are working so hard to make Sugar a terrific localized environment and the infrastructure team that provides our members with tools and services to make their live easier.
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
When you upgrade a computer running an earlier version,
The old datastore will be updated to the new format.
Your old profile (in
.sugar/default/config
) will be imported into GConf
If you later downgrade from Sucrose 0.83.x to an earlier version,
The datastore is incompatible
You will be prompted to enter all your profile settings like you are on first boot
Most of the activities in Sucrose 0.83.x should be compatible with Sucrose 0.82 , the version shipped with
XO Software Release 8.2.0
.  An exception is Browse, which depends on new versions of XULRunner and Hulahop.  Read likewise may soon depend on a new version of Evince
