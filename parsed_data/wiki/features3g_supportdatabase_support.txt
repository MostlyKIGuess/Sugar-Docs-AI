Summary
The 3G connectivity availability was only the first step. Next step is to provide a UX for easy configuration of 3G modems. Gnome allows users to enter details such as 'Country', 'Plan' and 'Provider' in a drop-down box fashion. This feature brings that functionality into Sugar.

Detailed Description
Provides and easy to use mechanism of entering the configuration settings for 3G modems. The user can select 'Country', 'Plan' and 'Provider' from drop down boxes, and the required settings for the modem will automatically be configured. For some modems which require specific user names or passwords, the user can still manually input those settings.
Thus this is an add-on to existing functionality, where all settings must be manually typed in into the text-entry fields.
Benefit to Sugar
Ease of use and configurability.
Scope
extensions/cpsection/modemconfiguration/config.py.in
extensions/cpsection/modemconfiguration/model.py
extensions/cpsection/modemconfiguration/view.py
The XML database for Country, Plan, Provider already included in builds.
UI Design
The UI has been kept consistent with what is provided in Gnome. Drop down boxes for Country, Plan and Provider are provided, which when entered, configure settings in the text fields below. Attaching screenshots:
New user interface with database support.
Old user interface without database support.
How To Test

Select the Country, Plan and Provider from the drop down boxes.
Verify that some values in the text entry fields were automatically set
