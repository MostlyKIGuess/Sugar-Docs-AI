About the Pilas.xo Project
Pilas is an engine for making videogames in an easy way. It's oriented to people that are learning to code videogames and that want to achive interesting and fun result very quickly.
This project brings the Pilas game development engine to Sugar, adapting it to the needs of the Sugar platform and adding elements to your learning curve. We seek to facilitate a teaching tool for Python and game development.
This project was developed during
Sugar Day Junin 2011

cd pilas/ 
hg update pilasqt
Getting Started
The Activity starts with the game engine initialised and a monkey (mono) preloaded. The monkey is displayed in the upper pane and the lower pane executes Python code in immediate mode
The following Pilas commands can be entered :
mono.sonreir()                       //monkey smile
mono.gritar()                        //monkey shout
mono.decir("Hello World!")  
mono.x = 100
mono.y = 100
mono.z = 1                           //depth or drawing order
mono.escala = 2                      //set scale
mono.rotacion = 40                   //rotate 40 degrees
mono.rotacion = [360]                // the [] means animate
mono.x = [-200, 200]                 //animate horizontally
mono.x = [-200, 200] * 5             //go side to side 5 times
mono.x = [-200, 200], 10             //animate over 10 seconds
help(mono)
pilas.ver(mono)                      //view source
mono.eliminar()                      //delete monkey
mono = pilas.actores.Mono()          //create a monkey instance
pilas.iniciar()                      //initialise the game engine
pilas.iniciar(gravedad=(0, 0))       //initialise and set gravity
//with pilas.actores you can create:
//Mono Bomba Pingu Pelota Banana       Monkey Bomb Penguin Ball Banana
//Caja Tortuga Moneda Estrella         Box Turtle Money Star
//Nave Piedra                          Plane Rock
pilas.ejemplos.Piezas ()             //starts a demonstration game
There is much more, read the Spanish documentation.

What has been done:
Packaging the pilas-engine
[6]
to run on Sugar.
Incorporation of PyQt libraries
[7]
into the activity
Adding widget ninja-ide
[8]
, to have the interactive shell on the same screen.
Generation of file dependencies needed for the project with PyInstaller
[9]
Creating the pilas.xo activity
To-do immediately:
Bug: resize widgets
Bug: set focus
Documentation of how it is packaged with Qt activity
[10]
for Sugar
define user guidelines and make mockups
typical Pippy examples
[11]
interpreter and code editor tabs
option to run in fullscreen or box
list of Pilas actions and behaviors
help tab
persistent options
Document examples / startup guide
Future Work
We must turn this into a roadmap ...
To-do:
Trim list of dependencies created PyInstaller, to include only what is needed
Incorporating autocomplete and inline help for the ninja-ide
Use dbus
[12]
to communicate with the menu of others
Incorporate Sugar persistence [persistence options or code to be developed]
Integrate code for the pilas-engine
[13]
and pilas.xo
Wish list
Refactoring to PyCairo
[14]
Incorporate into the activity the possibility of Sugar sharing
Add interactive options on objects (such as in eToys
[15]
)
Running Pilas from Pippy or Terminal
This is not working, help please!
Pippy:
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/olpc/Activities/Pilas.activity')
import pilas
pilas.iniciar()
Terminal:
Create a file myprogram.py in ~/Pilas.activity containing
import pilas
pilas.iniciar()
In Terminal type
python myprogram.py
