Hostnames

Hosted on
Machine/sunjammer
Administrative contact
sysadmin AT sugarlabs DOT org
For non-emergency calls, preferably send email to the administrative contact.
For urgent requests, the list of systems administrators is on
Machine/sunjammer
.
Prerequisites
A shell account;
requires a sponsor,
is only available to core contributors,
is only for when an existing public service such as GitHub cannot help.
A shell account makes sense only if you're
already
comfortable using ssh and the Linux command line. The SL systems administrators are not tutors.
Requesting a shell account
Fill up the following template and send it by email to
sysadmin
@
sugarlabs
.
org
:
Username: <[a-z]+>
First: <your first name(s)>
Last: <your last name(s)>
Email: <desired forwarding email destination for USERNAME@sugarlabs.org>
Sponsor(s): <names of people sponsoring your account request>

<intended purpose of account>

<public ssh key(s), one per line. don't attach, paste with word-wrapping disabled>
Please cc your sponsor(s)
Preferably sign your request with a GPG key uploaded to public keyservers and signed by at least another Sugar Labs member.
Accurately describe the intended purpose of your shell account.
Insufficiently justified requests will be delayed by the sysadmins to request further details.
Usage notes
Password Management
To change your password, you can visit
https://ldap.sugarlabs.org/passwd
.
To reset your password, send a GPG-signed request to the sysadmin contact.
Passwords expire every 6 months. You will receive an email remainder a few
days in advance. If you don't update your password, your account will be disabled,
including shell access via ssh public keys.
To conserve resources, shell accounts will be removed from the system after
6 months of inactivity.
Local email management
Instead of forwarding email to another account, you could use IMAP or our webmail.
See
Service/imap
and
Service/smtp
.
Public web hosting
The contents of
~/public_html
will be visible as
http://people.sugarlabs.org/USERNAME
and
http://people.sugarlabs.org/~USERNAME
.
You can use PHP in your web pages. It will execute with your credentials.
Do not distribute non-free software from your account, as this is not allowed by the terms of service of our host, the
Free Software Foundation
.
Public git hosting
You can publish your personal git repositories on
http://people.sugarlabs.org/gitweb
.
The repositories will also be accessible via the git protocol as
git://people.sugarlabs.org/USERNAME/REPONAME.git
Copy or symlink your repository to
~/public_git
.
Ensure that the path to your repository is publicly readable.
Touch the file
git-daemon-export-ok
in the repository.
OpenID
Your account provides an
OpenID
identity provider that can be
used to log into any OpenID-enabled service:
https://id.sugarlabs.org/USERNAME
.
IRC Proxies
You can run your favorite IRC client or proxy on your account. We also offer a system-wide
IRC Proxy
.
