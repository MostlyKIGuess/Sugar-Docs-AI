Hello.
<icarito>
hi!
<walter>
We start the deployment meeting in 20 minutes?
<BryanWB>
walter, hey!
<icarito>
i'm free, sure - we thought it was 40 min ago
<dirakx>
walter: yes np
<walter>
Oh my. Because of US daylight savings time ending, I am calculating UTC wrong.
<walter>
My sincere apologies.
<icarito>
walter: no problem, lets have the meeting in 20 min
<walter>
I need to update the Google calendar as well, which is set to 10am EST
<walter>
OK, Let us get started then.
<walter>
To me there is a very exciting prospect in the idea of local Sugar Labs.
<walter>
Everywhere I have traveled lately, there is interest in building a local group.
<walter>
David and I have been putting together a set of broad goals in the wiki.
<icarito>
oh, meeting now then?
<icarito>
ok

@dirakx: you type too fast
<dirakx>
walter: haha not at all.
<walter>
I have a group in India that is willing help develop a business plan
<dirakx>
walter: have all the legal issues being resolved ?
<walter>
No. But I think they are minimum.
<dirakx>
i mean for starters, i guess there is no problem in printing presentation cards ?

<walter>
No problem with that.
<dirakx>
ok ;)
<walter>
What I would like to do is build a collective understanding and framework for how this would work.
<dirakx>
it's stupid but that kind of things seems to be important to people.
<dirakx>
yep icarito and i are concerned about making a model for a local sugar labs also.
<dirakx>
we have some ideas about communities of practice for example..
<walter>
My hope is both autonomy and collaboration
<dirakx>
distribution also ;)
<walter>
I hope that there is an entrepreneurial spirit that emerges
<walter>
This should be self-sustaining for each local lab
<icarito>
yes, as dirakx said, we've been working on a model for a local community
<dirakx>
walter: for example we are trying that in here..but it was too difficult because our status of volunteers.
<BryanWB>
hmm, regarding autonomy. There are a lot of developers interested in OLPC here in Nepal but they are all web developers
<BryanWB>
we need to make it easier for web developers to create activities
<BryanWB>
they only have a few hours a week between their jobs, kids, and parents
<walter>
Each region should have its own passion... perhaps in Nepal Bryan has identified a local goal or mission
<BryanWB>
marcopg wrote about making it easier to create activities using web technologies a few weeks ago
<walter>
But I hope that the local Sugar Lab can be their job.. at least for some
<dirakx>
that's the idea..
<walter>
Can we help them start a service business, for example?
<icarito>
we have a model for providing services and some dev around sugar deployments as a non profit
<BryanWB>
walter, I think we can, esp. if we make it easy to create activities
<icarito>
and i'm talking with a province here to help them migrate 200 regular computer labs to sugar
<walter>
That is why I think it is important to establish some strawman business plans for the local groups
<dirakx>
but as SL can we charge for services?
<BryanWB>
walter, we get requests all the time build activities for specific niches
<walter>
I think that a local SL can be non-profit or for-profit--their choice--but in either case, there should not be an issue with charging for services.

<icarito>
walter: perhaps a couple of models could be proposed
<walter>
Free speech, not free beer.
<walter>
Yes.
<icarito>
there certainly is a market for consulting, integration, training and even development
<walter>
the models should meet the local needs and conditions.
<walter>
But we need to seed the process.
<BryanWB>
I think a model could be that a local SL could charge for consulting, integration, training, etc. but they release their work under an appropriate open-source license
<walter>
+1
<dirakx>
yes..i think in Colombia's case there is no problem to do a foundation that can charge for services.
<walter>
We should all agree to what the basic rules are and I think Bryan identified a key one.
<icarito>
each local sugarlabs should adapt and "appropiate" the model to the local reality
<walter>
yes.
<walter>
So the question is how can the collective SL help get this started
<dirakx>
but how could be the relationship between for example SL Colombia or Peru and SL USA ?
<icarito>
walter: yes BryanWB identified a core principle - we shuold make those prominent
<walter>
We all share the same code, the same ethics, the same goal
<dirakx>
mm ok.
<icarito>
i very much liked greg's comment that in large decentralized organizations "values are the organization"
<walter>
But the means to that goal will vary from place to place
<BryanWB>
i think standardizing on a license for code and one for content would be a good start
<BryanWB>
to make sure they are compatible b/w regional SL's
<walter>
Yes. What else should we standardize on?
<dirakx>
the kind of services that can be given ?
<BryanWB>
that's hard, different places need different services
<dirakx>
hmm ok.
<walter>
Anything necessary to help a deployment: localization, networks, activity develpment
<walter>
workshops
<BryanWB>
we do some electrical work, for example. connecting schools to power grid
<walter>
manuals/materials
<walter>
training trainers...
<walter>
and broadening the scope of the FOSS community as an economic force in the region
<dirakx>
that sounds cool.
<walter>
So let us make a list on the wiki and also a list of principles
<icarito>
...local organizations may have broader goals, for instance, in supporting/compatible areas like connectivity and providing open content...?
<icarito>
that makes me wonder where a regional sl starts and where it ends...
<walter>
and again, consider how the global community can help the leaves of the tree
<walter>
Does it really matter where the boundaries are?
<dirakx>
so i guess..we share same goals and licenses.
<dirakx>
icarito: that goals are implicit by the main goal.
<BryanWB>
it only matters when different countries have sufficiently distinct educational priorities
<BryanWB>
for example, Austria is really interested in doing novel kinds of education w/ the XO's
<walter>
Which is why we need a regional approach
<BryanWB>
while poorer countries are struggling to meet basic literacy . . .
<walter>
But we share a common platform and hopefully a great discovery in Austria re literacy can help NEpal.
<BryanWB>
definitely
<walter>
And vice versa
eben (n=eben@ip68-230-153-170.ri.ri.cox.net) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walter>
But we need to make sure that the local groups are sustainable...
<walter>
I want to create jobs.
<dirakx>
:)..that's  really thinking in a distributed way.
<walter>
Which is why we need some help wth creating business models.
<Gregorio>
my advice is to find one and do one well, then generalize from t here
<BryanWB>
the key to creating jobs is to make it dead easy to create activities
<icarito>
in fuentelibre's goals is exploring a replicable, escalable model
<Gregorio>
too much overhead up front may make it slower to get started
<icarito>
fuentelibre is finishing up its statutes
<walter>
I think Eben is here to start a design meeting on this channel...
<icarito>
and will be formally constituted sometime next week we hope
<eben>
indeed. :)
<icarito>
i'll share our mission and goals and model
<walter>
@Gregorio: +1
<eben>
We can postpone a little as necessary, of course.
<dirakx>
so here is the quiestion can we legally begin to make local sugar labs ?
<BryanWB>
a fuller activity template w/ stubs for lesson plan, game play, and review would help a lot
<walter>
Maybe we can all add to the wiki and then meet again in a week?
<walter>
I just made a one-page slide on Sugar Labs, globally.
<BryanWB>
sure
<icarito>
sure
<dirakx>
oj
<dirakx>
ok
<walter>
http://sugarlabs.org/wiki/images/3/3a/Sugarlabs-onepager.odp
<walter>
maybe the goal for next week is a one page slide on Sugar Labs local?
<tomeu>
after we get lots of local sugarlabs, we'll need to start thinking about mobile sugarlabs ;)
<walter>
Shall we cede the channel to Eben?? and meet again next week (9am EST, 14 UTC)?
<dirakx>
fine ;)
<walter>
Again, my apologies for mixing up the times.
<BryanWB>
np
<icarito>
ok i'm clear - no problem
<walter>
OK. Thanks everyone.
<dirakx>
so next week same time.
<walter>
Yes.
<dirakx>
thx
<BryanWB>
tks
