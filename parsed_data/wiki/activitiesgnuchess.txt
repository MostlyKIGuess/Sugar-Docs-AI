In order to castle on the Queen's side (O-O-O), move the King to c file.
When the King is put in check, its square will flash
When given a hint, the squares of the piece to move and its destination are flashed. Also, the hint is displayed in algebraic notation.

Additional notes re sharing
The Sugar colors of ones opponent appear on the 'human' button.
Only the sharing can start a new game.
Resuming is somewhat broken in Version 1.
Learning with Gnuchess
There is a rich history and long tradition of chess. It is arguably a fun way to engage in strategic thinking. It it is fun.
Extending Gnuchess
The basic rules of chess are involute in Gnuchess. However, you can have some fun with the graphics. When you share, your custom artwork is shared with your opponent, so each side can design their own look and feel.
