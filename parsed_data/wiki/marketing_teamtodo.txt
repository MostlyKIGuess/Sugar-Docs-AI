12/23/2008
We need a simple guide for people who don't know how to use IRC.  This should include (a) downloading clients for various OSes, and (b) using Mibbit, with screenshots. Connections via mibbit are no longer supported on freenode. You may wish to consider using
http://webchat.freenode.net
instead. Further information over at

We may have a number of people in our broader community who would like to blog about their experiences with Sugar, but don't know enough about how to blog.  JT will work on a newbie's guide to blogging Sugar as he creates a blog himself.  :)

Content on page is better.  Still need strong TODO pages for individual teams; gregdek will drive that.  We also need to move "get involved" to above the fold.
