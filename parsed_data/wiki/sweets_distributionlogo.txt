This is what first came to mind (as it represents easy engineering of the distribution), but it's probably too scary, and modifies an OLPC trademark. So withdrawn.

The logo is intended to literally say "Distribution of sweets".
Chris Leonard
Variations on theme meant to evoke swirled lollipop, "starlight mints" and intertwining.
