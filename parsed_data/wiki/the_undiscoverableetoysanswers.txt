Program tiles
You can find a menu of program tiles in every object browser, which you can get in any object halo by clicking on the eye icon.
Make tile
Drag any tile with an exclamation point icon in it to the workspace. A script window will open with that tile in it. Then you can drag other tiles into the same window. When you do so, a green area will highlight, showing where the new tile will go when you drop it. To drag a variable tile into a script window, click its left-pointing arrow. To drag it to the desktop, click anywhere else on it.
Objects
Typically you make objects in projects by drawing how you want them to appear, making the drawing a single object, then opening a code browser and creating scripts to tell it what to do.
Multimedia
There are multimedia objects on the tools palette for making projects.
Other Hints
