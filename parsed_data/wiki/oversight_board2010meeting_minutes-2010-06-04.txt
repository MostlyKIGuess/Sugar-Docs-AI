Certification
Trademark approval for Local Labs
We had granted provisional approval to the local labs to use our trademark. We need to formalize this.
Action:
Walter to gather various requests from local labs for use of our TM in one place
Devel Team Vacancies
We discussed the Release Manager position and agreed to continue to ask around.
Action:
Everyone to turn over more "stones" looking to fill the open positions
Certification
As per
[1
] we have a request to use the Sugar Labs TM as part of a certification of a developer class offered in Paraguay. We discussed the need to work closely with and trust our local labs; it was suggested that as proof of qualification that a Free activity on ASLO be posted; it was suggested that the course materials be public and available on the wiki.
Action:
Summarize the Certification discussion into a motion
