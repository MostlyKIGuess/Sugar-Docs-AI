[Sugar-devel] Sugar in Tuquito Distribution 3/27/2011:
I would like to learn more about Sugar and the procedures that are needed to
be folowed  in order to make that tuquito (
http://tuquito.org.ar
this is an
ubuntu derivated distribution) takes part of the distributions that are
officially supported by sugar.
I would like to tell you our case, and what we have done until now

1. Necessity
Classmate netbooks has been chosen in some provinces of Argentine and in the
"Conectar Igualdad Plan" (
http://www.conectarigualdad.gob.ar/
). These
computers will have distributions based on Ubuntu. One of the problems the
users of ubuntu are facing is that the packages of sugar are not up to date
or we have problems to compile the hulahop seccion and we have errors
executing the browse activity because of the updating of xulrunner .

2. Solutions
considering the situation that we have with the people of Tuquito, we have
decided to try to solve these problems and compile sugar from jhbuild. You
can see on these links 2 tickets created by me relating to this job (
http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/2496
http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/2629
).

3. Procedures that we have followed  to compile sugar in Tuquito (can be
applied in ubuntu 10.10 too)
first step:
In  /sugar-jhbuild/sjhbuild/sysdeps.py add the following line
Line 18: 'Tuquito': 'unstable',
in line 53 we add 'Tuquito'
Line 53: elif name in ['ubuntu', 'debian','Tuquito']:
second step
add 3 files to ~/sugar-jhbuild/config/sysdeps using the xml for ubuntu
cp 50ubuntu-10.10.xml 50tuquito-4.1.xml
cp 50ubuntu-allversions.xml 50tuquito-allversions.xml
cp 10ubuntu-allversions.xml 10tuquito-allversions.xml

third step
add the next packages to solve dependecies to compile

libgtk2.0-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libxml2-dev libpopt-dev python-dev libtool
intltool python-gconf python-gnome2-dev python2.7-dev python-gtk2-dev
python-gnome2-dev libgnome-desktop-dev libgnomecups1.0-dev libwnck-dev
librsvg2-dev gtk-doc-tools libtelepathy-glib-dev libasound2-dev icon-slicer
xulrunner-dev libcroco3-dev libtelepathy-glib-dev icon-naming-utils shtool
libgconf2-dev abiword espeak espeak-data libabiword-2.8-dev
libtelepathy-glib0 libdbus-glib-1-dev metacity pep8 pylint python-abiword
python-evince python-rsvg python-telepathy python-wnck python-xklavier
telepathy-gabble telepathy-salut xulrunner-1.9.2 python-lxlm y
python-beautifulsoup

forth step:
We have built a package to solve the xulruner problem. Here you can find the
package
http://acercadelaeducacion.com.ar/scripts/python_xpcom
with this procedure we are able to compile the sugar from jhbuild in tuquito
(in theory works in ubuntu 10.10 too)

A Question:
I have done this with short knowledge of sugar and with a lot of help from
the local chapter of sugarlabs (sugarlabs Argentina). Our aim would be to
officially reach the support of sugar in Tuquito.

   - Which procedure should we follow to be an official distribution for
   sugar?

Next Steps
In order to test this version of sugar I have done a script that builds the
package (sugar-jhbuild) and the sugar.desktop in /usr/share/applications.
This script also makes the xssesion to execute the sugar-emulator in full
screen mode. We would also like to make a version of Tuquito and sugar in
which the users could choose the enviroment to start the computer (gnome or
sugar and not the sugar-emulator). Could you explain us how to do this?
You can see the script here

Alvar

....clip....
By the way we are packing sugar-jhbuild in deb format, so later you can
install latest sugar in tuquito (or other debian distributions) from
repositories directly. With this the browse problem is fixed because we are
going to put in our repositories the package xpcom
http://www.acercadelaeducacion.com.ar/scripts/python_xpcom.deb
another thing I have made a patch for add support to tuquito in sugar I sent
it to sugar labs but I don't know the exactly steps for add changes to
sugar-repo so I attached this patch in this email so you maybe can add this
or send to the right people.
about tuquito license, it is licensed under GPL
