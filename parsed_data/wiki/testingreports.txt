Testing of all forms is welcome.
Testing is at the base of discovery.
When you try or test something, you learn what it has to offer.
If in the course of your Sugar experiences, you discover something you want to share, you can report on your experiences here under one of the
Testing/Reports
categories (or create a new one).
If you find software bugs, you can help the Sugar developers and others if you register a bug in our
bug tracker
.
You will get a wider readership if you also report to the
Sugar-devel mailing list
.
