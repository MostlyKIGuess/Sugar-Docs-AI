A review of installation methods
(This is a work in progress.  Please review and contribute.)
There are many alternative methods to install Sugar.  The options can be very confusing because of the technical details and features that may be unfamiliar.
This page begins to itemize some of the many options that are available for those interested in learning more about the possibilities.
Note:
When dealing with flash memory storage devices, such as 'USB sticks' and 'SD cards', one should be advised that changing the device format may affect its service lifetime.  Fortunately, the manufacturer's default format is suitable for many of the common options.
The methods that require reformatting are indicated by a colored background such as this.

I updated our patch to support the following models:
iMac9,1
MacBookAir2,1
MacBookPro5,5
MacBookPro6,2
I also spun up an F14 x86_64 live image with this patch.  Testing appreciated.

If anyone else is interested, I put together a boot helper for
Mirabelle. Burned to a CD, it enabled booting a USB stick on my
MacBook Pro. The stick was partitioned with the plain old MBR format
and labeled "FEDORA". I also got both VMware Fusion and VirtualBox to
boot the USB stick using this boot helper ISO. The soas-2-boot ISO
sort of works with Mirabelle sticks, but they have different kernel
versions so modules don't load, thus no networking. That is fixed in
this build.

Installation to HD, USB hard drive, and USB/SD flash drives
The
LiveOS image
technology uses compression to install operating systems on smaller discs such as CD-ROMs and small USB/SD flash storage devices.
The extra compression layer may be avoided by installing to an uncompressed file system by one of the methods itemized in the first section below:
Uncompressed file systems
livecd-iso-to-disk script using the --skipcompress option
livecd-iso-to-disk --skipcompress --overlay-size-mm <NN> --home-size-mb <NN> --delete-home --unencrypted-home /path/to/isofile/or/mounted/image /dev/sd

zyx-liveinstaller <from Ferminal>
Sugar_on_a_Stick/ZyX-LiveInstaller
creates real file structure on USB or HD (without rebooting)
name and color selection (and ssh keys remain the same)
This can be a problem for using it for distribution
liveinst (Anaconda)<from Terminal>
Sugar_on_a_Stick/Linux/Non-compressed_Fedora#Use_liveinst_command_in_terminal
installs to HD or USB stick
If you make an .img file from the USB before running "firstboot", it becomes a good way to duplicate the sticks.
Net install CD
Sugar_on_a_Stick/Linux/Non-compressed_Fedora#Make_your_OWN_Custom_SUGAR-DESKTOP_USB_Boot_Stick
need a fast Internet connection
very slow install(6+ hours for USB)
allows custom install of sugar-desktop only or Gnome/KDE + Sugar
If you make an .img file from the USB before running "firstboot", it becomes a good way to duplicate the sticks.
CopyÂ :     dd if=/dev/sd(x) of=xxxxxx.img [1] see below

live-usbcreator application
Download the latest version of the Fedora LiveUSB Creator from
http://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator
and extract it.
Plug a blank target USB flash drive (or SD Card) into your computer (minimum 1-gigabyte).
Launch LiveUSB Creator.
Select Sugar on a Stick v2 Blueberry in the drop-down menu on the upper-right side to download the liveUSB disk image. Alternatively, download Blueberry here, then hit the Browse button and select the downloaded file.
Adjust the Persistent Storage slider. This enables you to save the child's work in Sugar onto the device.
Select your flash drive as the target and click the Create Live USB button.
Wait for the process to finish, then close the LiveUSB Creator program.
Stop your flash drive using the Safely Remove Hardware dialog and eject it.

4 dd write to USB
(Very DANGEROUS-can destroy your Hard Drive)
USE "mount" command to determine USB device name (ie: /dev/sdb;/dev/sdc/;/dev/sdd ...etc)  [1]
Fastest way to write a LIVE usb  (about 3.5 minutes for a Soas.iso)
No persistence
Functionally identical to Burned CD
Great for installation when there is no CD/DVD drive (netbooks)
Example when live.iso is on Desktop (root terminal):
cd Desktop
dd if=soas-i386-20101004.16.iso of=/dev/sd(x)  [1]

Upgrade an XO-1 to Sugar 0.84 with Fedora 11 and Gnome
WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE YOUR NAND in the XO-1 with the new OS.
Please read the instructions found
on the OLPC News site
. Refer to Message #3: "How to install". You must have a Developer Key, and security disabled on your OLPC.
Please note: Software has been updated since that posting. The latest Software is available here:
http://people.sugarlabs.org/bernie/olpc/f11-xo1-py/?C=M;O=D
Note: Be sure to plug in your laptop using its AC charger to ensure that the installation process is completed. (The firmware will not be updated under battery power.)
Put the two corresponding files (.img and .crc) of the same version-number on a bootable USB/SD device formated as FAT32.
Add your
Developer Key
to the USB.
Be certain to disable OLPC-security first as per the instructions.
You can control this, when Open firmware prompts: "No WP Tag" it means "is already disabled".
Connect your device to the OLPC
Boot while holding down the "checkmark button".
When Open Firmware counts down 3 seconds "...before automatic startup", push the "escape button", to get to the "OK" Open Firmware prompt.
If the files were downloaded onto an USB stick:
type
probe-usb
Press Enter.
Control if Open Firmware has detected your device. (A "found" usb when probing, e.g., usb:/***/disk means you have to name it in the command:
copy-nand disk:\os***py.img
)
Then type
copy-nand usb:\os***py.img
and press Enter.
(note: replace *** with your actual versionnumber/filename.)
If the files were downloaded onto a SD card:
type
copy-nand sd:\os***py.img
and press Enter.
when the colored points aren't changing anymore, and Open Firmware says: OK
disconnect your USB/SD device and type
reboot
When there happens a failure message (or no at all but no booting-process), try to overwrite your files a second time, try to re-download your file (eg "crc miscompare"), try to reformat your usb-stick (eg "is not a multiple of the nand erase block size"), try googling... (one time it helped to remove batteries for approximately 10 seconds. There are anecdotal cases where this resets the electronic controller that has unhung.)
try!
In the case of success:
Enjoy!
WARNING: THIS WILL OVERWRITE YOUR NAND in the XO-1 with the new OS.

This page still recommends the Fedora LiveUSB installation method as the PREFERRED method for Windows SOAS, despite the known problem of eventual overlay corruption.  At a minimum, the Windows section should state that the Live-USB method is easiest but should be used only for temporary SOAS sticks or for evaluation purposes, and NOT for long-term sticks.  See
Sugar on a Stick
/Windows, Live USB - "(This installation method is NOT recommended for LONG-TERM usage of Sugar on a Stick!! Catastrophic data corruption may occur when the USB stick gets full! See why.) "
