Hello everyone I am David Silverman. I am currently a third year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am primarily and artist and designer however I do have a good deal of programming experience under my belt. I will moist likely be working on a an adventure game for the Math 4 curriculum with 4 other students in my class. We are still very early in the planning stages of the project however once we have a design document up for it I will be putting links to that, our Git page, and the pages of all of my team members on this page. Finally if you need some way to contact me I cvan be reached through the e-mails nibor123@gmail.com, nibor1234@gmail.com, and drs5669@rit.edu. All of these e-mails are forwarded to one account which I check more than 30 times a day, at least once an hour, so I should get back to you very soon.
