Activity to restore the Journal content from Journal entry bundles (JEBs) like those written by the Backup activity. *Restore worked from 2 partition USB where jounal backup resided in 2nd partition on USB "MyFiles" see
[3]
Supports any data store from 0.84 on, including those with version support. You can use Backup to dump the contents of one data store and use Restore to import them into any other data store.
Only entries older than what's in the backup will be overwritten, so it's safe to run it multiple times and even import backups from other (non-malicious) users.
