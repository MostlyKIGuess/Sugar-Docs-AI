Please add your self to the table above so we can get a rough idea of which dates/venues work for the most people.
We are looking into funding to help defray some of the travel costs. But what ever money we can raise will undoubtedly be limited.
We are also debating topics for the Camp. While who can attend will impact our choice of topic, some ideas that have been discussed include:
Topic
Rationale
Python 'introspection' and GTK3 sprint
"right now we're stuck on deprecated code (pygtk) that no-one wants to maintain any more"
Activity sprint
Bring all of the Sugar activities to a consistent, up-to-date standard (including consideration of ^^)
Collaboration sprint
Update Sugar collaboration to reflect advances made since we developed our model.
Multitouch sprint
Requires GTK3 support.
Sugar PMS and SDK
Easy to run, easy to change, easy to share
