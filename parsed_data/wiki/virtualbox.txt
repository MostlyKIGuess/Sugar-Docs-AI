With
VirtualBox
Â®
one can run
Sugar
on Microsoft Windows, Intel-based  Apple Macintosh, or GNU/Linux host computers from within a virtual machine window.
See this
VirtualBox overview
. VirtualBox is a large software installation with many features and operating system options. A
User Manual and other documentation
is available online. Those who have not used VirtualBox before, might find it more easy to understand and install than expected.

The following instructions are intended for those Learners interested in using VirtualBox to run Sugar.  The process is not fully mature as the technology is evolving both in the VirtualBox and operating system software.

Click Open
Click Select
Click Next

Setup a Virtual Machine for Ubuntu Sugar
Use Ubuntu Software Centre to install the
virtualbox-guest-utils
package, so that your virtual machine display can be resized to fit your computer.
Issues
Activating the Frame might be a little difficult. The lower 2 corners are easiest and you may want to configure edge activation in the My Settings > Frame panel.  With VirtualBox Guest Additions installed (see
here
), only the bottom edge and corners are available for Frame activation.
On Mac keyboards, you might wish to change the Virtual Box default key for switching the Sugar cursor to the normal one, as the default key (control right arrow on Mac keyboards) is trapped by Sugar. (Windows and Linux keyboards use Right Ctrl.) You may do this change in File/settings of the Virtual Box menu.
