Sugar Digest
1. Thanks to the input from many members of our devel community, we were able to finalize our application to Google Summer of Code. Our application is mirrored in the wiki (See
Summer_of_Code/2013/Application
). Our final list of project ideas and mentors is quite impressive in terms of scope and impact (
Summer_of_Code/2013
). We should know in about 10 days whether or not we are accepted.
2. I've been working on the webservices patch the past few days. Daniel Narvaez has been reviewing the code -- we are experimenting with a new work flow using
github
-- and as a consequence, I am slowly getting it into shape.
I have also been developing a mechanism for loading webservices from user space, e.g., ~/.sugar/extensions. This way, webservices can be loaded either by inclusion in a build or by installation by the user.

3. Daniel has also agreed to be the release manager for our next release (See
0.100/Roadmap
).
