Targeted release: 0.115-0.116
Last updated: 30th August 2019
Percentage of completion: 70%
Detailed Description
The XO icon on the Sugar desktop changes according to:
Number of Journal entries. If number of journal entries are less than 10, the embryo will be the style. If the number of journal entries is between 10 and 50, Teen style is selected. For more than 50 journal entries, the Adult style will be selected.
Battery status. Badges are shown if a battery is detected. The badge uses the existing battery icon in the Sugar artwork.
Disk usage. Currently, the icons will only change for when disk status is below 50%, greater than 50% or greater than 90%. The stroke size of the icons will change accordingly.
Provides a setting (GSettings) to enable or disable the feature.
In future, the widget will be based on Cairo and will not be using icons for the styles.
Benefit to Sugar
This feature provides a visual update to the existing XO icon on the Sugar desktop. The user will know more about their Journal, their disk and battery status from the Desktop. The idea was to make the XO icon adapt according to the properties state above for better user experience.
