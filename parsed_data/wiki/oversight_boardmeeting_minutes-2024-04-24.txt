GSoC and DMP report
We submitted 14 proposals to GSoC. Interns hear back from Google on 1 May.
We have 4 slots in the DMP program.
Election
Who will run it? (Claudia suggested Martin)
When will it be held?
What seats are open? (Walter's; Alex's; Samson's)
Who can vote?
How to we solicit contributors to become members?
ED Announcement
We never finished drafting the announcement -- in large part because of the election uncertainty. We can make a pared down announcement. Devin and Walter will work on it.
