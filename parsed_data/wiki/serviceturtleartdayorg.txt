Notes
In
https://github.com/sugarlabs/turtleartday.org/settings/hooks
there is a webhook defined, as documented at
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/
This sends a POST request in JSON format to
https://hook.sugarlabs.org/www.turtleartday.org
A container named org.turtleartday.www-rebuilder is in charge of processing this payload, which does the following:
1. Install jekyll.
2. Clone the SL repo.
3. Install Flask
4. Execute a Flask Python App which does the following: pull the repo and jekyll build. This app doesn't parse the POST request.
The site is generated in the folder /clone/_site which is bind to the following directory in freedom: /srv/www-turtleartday.org-out. This is the document root for the site turtleartday.org in the nginx server block.
Upgrade notes
Remember to restart the org.turtleartday.www-rebuilder container after upgrading freedom.
