Customize your own remix of Sugar on a Stick.
We realize that we'll never be able to create an Activity selection suitable for all deployments. SoaS 10 now includes a set of teacher-tested Activities in the default image. The following links point the way to building alternative customizations.

Sugar on a Stick is a Fedora Spin.
Sugar on a Stick is recognized by the
Fedora Project
as an official
Spin
.  These close ties with Fedora's release cycle and resources from their engineering and marketing teams extends the reach of Sugar on a Stick and makes the project itself more sustainable. In exchange, users of Fedora have access to an easily deployable implementation of the Sugar Platform; it's a great example of a mutually beneficial upstreamâ€“downstream relationship.
Contributing to Sugar on a Stick
The team recognizes the need to continue to improve its release processes and engineering sustainability. New contributors are urged to get involved and help us move towards our long-term vision of bringing stability and deployability to Sugar's personalized learning environment.

QA
Much thanks to Peter Robinson who did a majority of the work to program, prepare and coordinate the work with many other sugar developers for this release.
Thomas Gilliard did field-testing (building real SoaS sticks from .iso files and testing on those) - it's the closest thing to systematic testing we've had yet, though we still have a ways to go.
Thank you also to James Cameron in Australia for his testing help!
Much help was also provided by the team at #fedora-qa; freenode IRC

Documentation
A new release of documentation should come out with each new release of SoaS (although resources have prevented this).
The Fedora-site documentation seem not to be an improvement over our Sugar Labs, ad hoc wiki documentation methods, as the tools needed to participate are more complicated & yet to be used since Mirabelle was released in May 2010.  The only help links on the Fedora Spins download page,
How do I use this file?
, are very complicated with generic information for Fedora installations.
Our attempts to better support a small number of known, working, "how to set up SoaS", instructions have yet to be fulfilled.
