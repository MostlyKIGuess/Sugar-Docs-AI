Targeted release: 0.90

Percentage of completion: 100%
Detailed Description
This feature adds a ToolButton to the Journal toolbar. In its palette, the user can select the following sorting criteria: "Sort by file size", "Sort by last edit", "Sort by creation date".
Benefit to Sugar
Sorting by filesize is vital in the field where users need to free up disk space. Currently, the only way to find candidates for deletion is to access the expanded view of each entry, one by one. This can be a very time consuming process and often leads to indiscriminate deletion and thus potential loss of valuable data. This is bad.
Sorting by creation time (ctime) is also implemented as described in the Design
Proposal.
This feature was requested in
