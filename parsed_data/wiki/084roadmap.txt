Sucrose Development
(reconstructed from 16 June 2009 Google cache.)
Sucrose 0.83.x is an unstable development series intended for testing and development purposes. Sucrose uses odd minor version numbers to indicate development status, so this unstable 0.83.x series will eventually become the 0.84 stable release.
