Materials:
XO computer
Preparation:
Set up the XO computer with Produce Puzzle activated. Then choose Level 1 (Easy)
Goals
Goals is to understand what algebra does and why it is useful. The idea that the student can create an equation that to solve the value for each fruit. Using symbols of fruits allows student to determine that the value is consistant throughout.
Objectives
Using simple algebra, if the student see 2 different types of fruits two oranges and kiwi the student can determine that 2Oranges+1Kiwi=10. With one of the fruits value already given, the student can calculate how much is the missing fruit
Vocabulary
Add, Subtract, multiply
Instruction
For the first line:
Count how many Fruits of each kind are in that row equals to the number on the end
2Orange+1Kiwi=10
If the given value for the fruit Orange is 2, we can determine the kiwi
2(2) +kiwi=10
4+kiwi=10
Kiwi=10-4
Kiwi=6
Rationale
To solve for the kiwi or for any fruit, those are the logical steps to solve for the value. If we know the total is 10, and the known values are two oranges which equal to 2 each, than we subtract that from the total, to get the number value of kiwi.
Supporting Materials
The previous example would be a great resource on the board or some visual reference so students can “figure out” how to impliment it on other steps.
Activities & Procedures
Formulating equation: 5 minutes
Calculating given Values: 2 minutes
Solving for missing Symbols: 3 minutes
Total should be 10 minutes for each question
Lesson Closure
This could be a good place to put more practice out so students can work on for homework. Closing remarks could encourage students to keep in mind when shopping for fruits, if it cost $2 for 3 apples, how much is each apple?
Standard Descriptions
Student can understand how to formulate equations independently

Goals
Goals is to understand what algebra does and why it is useful. The idea that the student can create an equation that to solve the value for each fruit. Using symbols of fruits allows student to determine that the value is consistant throughout. Changing the value of one symbol can change the total output
Objectives
Using simple algebra, if the student see 2 different types of fruits two oranges and kiwi the student can determine that 2Oranges+1Kiwi=10. With one of the fruits value already given, the student can calculate how much is the missing fruit. If the student moves to the next problem, the values of each fruit is not the same anymore. The values of each fruit is different. Therefore, the total output at the end is different.
Vocabulary
Add, Subtract, multiply
Instruction
With the first problem:
Count how many Fruits of each kind are in that row equals to the number on the end
2Orange+1Kiwi=10
If the given value for the fruit Orange is 2, we can determine the kiwi
2(2) +kiwi=10
4+kiwi=10
Kiwi=10-4
Kiwi=6
Second problem:
Count how many Fruits of each kind are in that row equals to the number on the end
5Orange+4Kiwi=80
If the given value for the fruit Orange is 6, we can determine the kiwi
5(6) +4kiwi=80
30+4kiwi=80
4Kiwi=80-30
4Kiwi=50
Kiwi= 50/4
Kiwi=12 ½
Rationale
To solve for the kiwi or for any fruit, those are the logical steps to solve for the value. If we know the total is 10, and the known values are two oranges which equal to 2 each, than we subtract that from the total, to get the number value of kiwi. Going to another problem, the values of each item changes and the students realizes that the variable for each fruit is different therefore the outcome is different.
Supporting Materials

Activities & Procedures
Formulating equation: 5 minutes
Calculating given Values: 2 minutes
Solving for missing Symbols: 3 minutes
Total should be 10 minutes for each question. Then for another question would be another 10 minutes.
