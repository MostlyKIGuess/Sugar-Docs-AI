Continuing goals
(unending)
Monitor Sugar Labs community communications to learn of potential wiki content or service improvements.
Monitor Sugar Labs' and collaborators' wikis contents for potential improvements.
Address
#tickets
.
Near-term goals
(3-6 months)
Monitor OpenQwaq service development for potential collaboration with wiki services.
Monitor
mediawikiwiki:Extension:WikiEditor
for sufficient maturation for our use.
Monitor
www.sugarlabs.org website plans
for integration with this wiki.
Medium-term goals
(6-12 months)
Investigate inter-wiki searching options that would allow for joint searching of Sugar Labs and collaborator wikis.
Seek collaboration on better separation and joining of information between collaborator wikis,
i.e.
,
Human Interface Guidelines
and
OLPC Human Interface Guidelines
, where versions are diverging.
Long-term goals
(1-3+ years)
Seek more ways to automatically embed integrative links on mailing list posts, patchwork, gitorious, bugs, doc, translate, etc. products so Learners can easily navigate to the
source
.
Constraints
What does the team see as its constraints from being more successful in its Mission?
Participation
Technological complexity
Complexity of organizing information
What are we doing to try to resolve the constraint?
Maintain quality of information and service.
Watch for prime wiki applications where thresholds are low and ceilings high.
What can Sugar Labs 'central' or the community do to help?
Promote greater documentation and interlinking of information.
Attract more participants by public discussion.

Test wikis
Note:
The following two wikis share the same page database, but have separate server configurations.
Set up
http://wiki-devel.sugarlabs.org
for experimentation (Installed on Sunjammer at /srv/www-sugarlabs/wiki-devel/)
Set up
http://wiki-testing.sugarlabs.org
for testing (Installed on Sunjammer at /srv/www-sugarlabs/wiki-testing/)
Test interwiki transclusion for economy of shared page maintenance. See
Template:Transclude
.
Test new skin designs. See
/Wiki skin redesign
.
wiki.laptop.org
Follow up on marking pages on w.lt.o as migrated.
See
open bugs
for the remaining open bugs.
Usability
Install
mediawikiwiki:Extension:NewArticleTemplates
for easier new page editing support for new and experienced users. (Lower floor and raise ceiling.)
include separate subpage template
investigate to determine if the Mediawiki:NewArticleTemplate could include a template parameter that would default to Mediawiki:NewArticleTemplateDefault, but allow an arbitrary NS_MAIN page to be called for customization.
If you want a button to "create a new page", you can use
Extension:Inputbox

Make
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Events
More useful at communicating what is happening in the community.
Clean up the process of planning, holding, and documenting team meeting on the wiki.
Consider embedding Nabble's
Sugar Forum
to provide a mailing list forum environment on the wiki.
Correct broken links at
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=Special:WantedPages&limit=500&offset=0
Update the wiki translation infrastructure.  There have been alot of advances in mediawiki translations since OLPC developed the wiki translation mechanism we currently use.  A good source of advice and information may be
http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Main_Page
.
WYSIWYG editor
Potential
If and when
wiki.sugarlabs.org has a lot of information that can be displayed, queried, and summarized in multiple places, the
olpc:Semantic MediaWiki
extension is the way to represent it.  As of March 2009 it's unclear if there is a compelling use case for it.
