Technical Discussion of Live USB's:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_and_use_Live_USB#Data_Persistence
Limited Lifetime of Persistent Overlay
One very important note about using the "primary" persistent overlay for system changes is that due to the way it's currently implemented (as a LVM copy-on-write snapshot),
every single change to it (writes AND deletes) subtracts from its free space, so it will eventually be "used up" and your USB stick will no longer boot.
Because of these limitations, it is advisable to use the system-level persistence sparingly, for configuration changes and important security updates only.
For a truly persistent write-many (vs write-once) overlay, use the --home-size-mb option to create a home directory filesystem image for personal files.
Unlike the primary system overlay image, the home.img can be re-used and loop mounted outside of the liveusb environment.
Cautions with u3 USB sticks
USB sticks with u3 partition will not boot with liveusb-creator
CAUTION:
Formatting the USB-stick will not remove the hidden (virtual CD-ROM drive)
How to remove hidden u3 partition
Linux:
http://u3-tool.sourceforge.net/
Windoz: Insert u3 Stick then click on tray icon for u3; select delete u3 partition, once it is deleted the USB-stick will work with liveusb-creator

How to make your own custom Sugar-Creation_Kit.iso file
(How this DVD was converted to an .iso file)
Collect, annotate and sort the files you want in a folder on your Desktop.
Burn the contents of this folder to a CD or DVD.
Use the following command in Terminal as the root user:
dd if=/dev/sr0 of=Sugar-Creation-Kit.iso
/dev/sr0 is the device name for your DVD/CD drive
Sample output:
dd if=/dev/sr0 of=Sugar-Creation-Kit.iso
 5555584+0 records in
 5555584+0 records out
 2844459008 bytes (2.8 GB) copied, 232.86 s, 12.2 MB/s
the resulting .iso file can be sent over the internet or used to make copies by burning to a DVD
copy items between a USB drive and Sugar Journal
copy files between the sugar-journal and a 2nd USB-stick

Start Gnome3 in Fallback Mode
"You can force fallback mode from a VT,much faster than trying to get through the control center, with this command:
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session session-name 'gnome-fallback'
With live CD or USB liveuser
run it as user - not root - then log out and back in again.
Switching between text consoles in a Linux virtual machine When the CTRL + ALT + F1 key combination is used to switch to another text console (terminal) on a Linux virtual machine,
the host switches to a text console instead of the guest.
Resolution The CTRL + ALT combination is used by VMware to direct the keyboard input to the host. Press CTRL + ALT + Space , press the F1 key (or desired Function key) while still holding down CTRL + ALT .

Translated from Spanish with google translate:
There is a special package for an existing program sugarizar X11 using a bash script and a library specially created for it,
here let the package be zipped for download:
Sugarizar_software.zip
Just unzip the file and run the script found in the package and you answering the questions,
the script will generate a directory with the activity for sugar, then you should give the required permissions to  each file and directory
as explained in the main page this site and package the directory
to download the activity from the x or directly copy the entire directory to / home / olpc / Activities on the XO.
