Migrate the code
If you are not the author of the activity,
query
the author to let them know about the move.
Create
an account on
http://github.com
and
log in
. Add your public SSH key to
your account
.
Create a new project
(
http://github.com
, Your repositories, New repository).
Clone
your activity from
github.com
.
git clone
git://github.com/
username
/pippy.git
If
you want to migrate a non-master branch...
git remote show origin
git checkout -b sucrose-0.82 origin/sucrose-0.82
Push
to git.sugarlabs.org with something like:
git push git@github.com:
username
/pippy.git --mirror
Clone
the project from the new repository in order to be able to push your changes.  You'll need to do a git clone into an empty directory, using the same URL you used with your previous push:
git clone git@github.com:
username
/pippy.git
If you're getting a message saying
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
that probably means that this URL is incorrect.
