Background
Activities/TurtleArt
is a visual programming language for children based on the LOGO language originally developed by Seymour Papert, Cynthia Solomon, et al. in the 1960s at BBN and MIT. Turtle Art is one of the ways in which we get children as young as five to six programming and debugging on the Sugar platform. Although we have
extensive pages
in the wiki describing Turtle Art, and some introductory tutorials
[1]
,
[2]
, and
[3]
, we are nonetheless lacking a basic introduction to the program, both for learners and teachers.
Task
Write a guide to Turtle Art that can be shown when the activity is first launched. (A
half-hearted attempt to write such a guide
was abandoned. A
lovely guide
to the web-based Turtle Art might serve as inspiration.)
