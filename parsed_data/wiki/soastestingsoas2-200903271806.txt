won't boot on XO-1 with q2e33 firmware, with a workaround
I downloaded Soas2-200903271806.iso and ran latest LiveUSB-Creator 3.6.3 under Windows XP to put it and a 256 MB persistent storage area on a USB flash drive.
Insert the USB flash drive, power on XO-1, hold down check key.
The hot dog is back!
After a minute the screen goes dark.
After another 90 seconds of dark screen I get the blue swirl Login: screen with "liveuser",
Log in.
After several seconds that goes to dark screen, and a few seconds later I'm back at the blue Login: screen.Â :-(

The file "/var/log/slim.log" has various errors.  There is no /home/liveuser/.Xauthority file, and
/home/liveuser
is

chgrp liveuser /home/liveuser
login proceeded fine.  I filed

DHCP problems
In neighborhood view I see my old BEFWS11 Linksys access point, I click to connect, I get a password dialog, I enter my 128-bit WEP key.  After a long pause I get the dialog again.
/var/log/messages
suggests that NetworkManager is connected successfully to my AP:
Stage 2 of 5 (Device Configure) successful. Connected to wireless network
mynet
but then it seems to fail in DHCP access
avahi-daemon(1932): Registering new address record for 'nn:nn' on eth0.*.
 ...
 NetworkManager: <info> Device 'eth0' DHCP transaction took too long (>45s), stopping it.
and I get the dialog again.
