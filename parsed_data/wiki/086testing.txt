On machine A connect to an ad hoc network. Start machine B which has been connected to an access point before.
--->
On machine B it should automatically connect to the access point and the icon representing the ad hoc network machine A is connected to should be colored, the fill color is set.
Shut down machine A.
--->
after 10-15 minutes the icon representing the ad hoc network machine A is connected to should be uncolored, the fill color is NOT set. This is indicates that there are no members on the network.
Collaborate between XO-1.0 and XO-1.5 without infrastructure
The XO-1.5 and XO-1.0 will see ad hoc networks in his neighborhood view, so it the XO-1.0 can connect to an ad hoc network that has been created by a learner on the XO-1.5.
