What is Sugar on a Stick?
Sugar on a Stick
is a
Fedora
®
Spin
operating system featuring the award-winning
Sugar Learning Platform
.
Sugar on a Stick will run on
any 64-bit Notebook, Laptop, or Desktop computer,  with a minimum of 1GB RAM, that can run Linux, Windows or macOS, using a USB thumbdrive or stick, as a
Live USB
,

Sugar on a Stick installation instructions
MS Windows
Prepare
:
Download
the Fedora Live USB Creator from
FedoraHosted
.
Download
the latest
Sugar on a Stick
.iso file.
Load
: Insert a USB flash drive (or SD Card) with 2 GB or more of free space into your computer and launch Fedora Live USB Creator to create a Sugar-on-a-Stick bootable image.
Note
: Be sure to set the
persistent storage
slider to a non-zero value.
Boot
: Insert the USB stick into a USB port on your computer. Set the option to "boot from USB" in your computer's
BIOS
setup, and then start up the computer.
Detailed
installation instructions for Windows
and
booting instructions
are available. There is also a
guide to exploring Sugar
.
GNU/Linux
Download
the latest
Sugar on a Stick
.iso file.
Prepare
: (with
root
user
permissions at a terminal or
console
command line)
Create a mount point directory:
mkdir /run/soas
Mount the .iso file to make it accessible as a disk:
mount
/path/to/downloaded
.iso /run/soas/
(Where
/path/to/downloaded
.iso is the
filesystem
path, or fully specified name,
of the downloaded .iso file.)
This is the source for the installation, and must remain
mounted
until the installation is complete.
Insert a USB stick of 2 GB or greater capacity into your computer.
With
root
user
permissions at a terminal or
console
command line, use the command
sudo df -Th
or
sudo blkid
to get the USB device node name.
(Items in angle brackets, such as <MyAccount> are descriptive placeholders.)
You should see something like the following:
[<user>@<system> <working directory>]$ sudo df -Th

/dev/loop0     iso9660   942M  942M     0 100% /run/soas
(The
/run/media/<MyAccount>/
path is the standard mount point for removable media.
/media/<MyMountPoint>
is common on other operating systems.)
[<user>@<system> <working directory>]$ sudo blkid
/dev/sda1: LABEL="Fedora30" UUID="dddf4ae0-e1fd-43c3-bacc-91acbafb3a34" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="000b2340-03"

(Additional disk drive partitions may be listed on your computer.)
The mount point (Mounted on), Filesystem, Size, and LABEL should help you identify what you want.
Unmount the USB device filesystem:
umount /run/media/<MyAccount>/<MyUSBdiscMountPoint>
(The
/run/media/<MyAccount>/
path is the standard mount point. Other operating systems may use
/media/<MyMountPoint>
.)
(You should have the isomd5sum package installed so that the following installation script can verify the download.)
Load
: Execute the following installation command, as the
root
user
, in
one
command line with many options:
/run/soas/LiveOS/livecd-iso-to-disk --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb
500
--home-size-mb
500
--unencrypted-home
/path/to/downloaded
.iso /dev/sd
?
1
The '
?
' in the final parameter represents the target USB device
s
csi
d
rive
node, such as
sd
b
1
or
sd
c
1
, etc., and
/path/to/downloaded
.iso
is the location and name of the .iso file.
The operating system will occupy ~960 MB, and the overlay and home size arguments,
500
and
500
, were selected to fit in a 2 GB device. These may be adjusted depending on your preferences and device capacity (see
LiveOS image
). On a 4 GB device, one might use
1000
and
1600
for the size arguments.
The installation transcript should look something like the following:
[<user>@<system> <working directory>]$ sudo /run/soas/LiveOS/livecd-iso-to-disk --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb 500 --home-size-mb 500 --unencrypted-home /<path to>/Fedora-SoaS-Live-x86_64-30-1.2.iso /dev/sdc1

.
Detailed
installation instructions for GNU/Linux
and
booting instructions
are available. There is also a
guide to exploring Sugar
.
GNU/Linux users may also want to install the
Sugar packages
on their favorite distro, apart from Sugar on a Stick.
Apple Mac OS X
The instructions below are based on the Ubuntu Web page at <
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx
>.
Prepare
: These instructions are for
32-bit
and
64-bit
processors.
Download
the latest
Sugar on a Stick
.iso file.
Load
:
Here is a simple way to load a bootable USB on a Mac.
Enter the Terminal:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
.
Type
diskutil list
. You should see all the disk drives you have inserted into your computer.
Insert the disk drive to which you want to write Sugar on a Stick.
Type
diskutil list
again. You should see that your USB drive has been added to the list. If not, wait a while and repeat.
Type
hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o <
Sugar on a Stick image file
>.img <
Sugar on a Stick image file
>
to convert the image into a bootable format.
Type
sudo diskutil unmountDisk <
device name
>
to unmount the disk (it will not be ejected).
Type
sudo dd if=<
Sugar on a Stick image file
>.img.dmg of=<
device name
> bs=1m
.
sudo
will ask for your password, and then
dd
will start writing the disk file.
When
dd
finishes writing the disk file, type
sudo diskutil eject <
device name
>
.
Boot
: Insert the USB stick into a USB port on your computer, then reboot and press and hold the Option key while rebooting. You should see a list of all the EFI-recognizable USB drives that can be bootstrapped. If Sugar on a Stick is not one such drive, it cannot be bootstrapped: you need rEFInd (a fork of rEFIt).

Advanced users
Do you have an OLPC XO?
Upgrade
to the latest
olpc:Releases
from OLPC (which may require a
developer key
).
Experiment
with
Updating XOs
to the latest
Sugar on a Stick
release.
Some alternate installations
Once you download, and then burn or load a Sugar on a Stick (SoaS) .iso file, and boot it, the running Fedora 34 SoaS Live CD/USB may be used to install Fedora with Sugar to a hard disk or a 4 GB USB stick
with the
liveinst
command
.
- You start with a SoaS LiveOS image, and then load an uncompressed version onto the hard disk or USB stick.
Want to contribute to Sugar on a Stick?
You're in the right place! This page is a contributors portal to the project, and contains everything you need to get started in becoming part of the Sugar on a Stick community.
New contributors start here!
Welcome! We're excited that you want to help us bring the Sugar Learning Platform to children around the world. No prior experience with computers or educational technology is required - in fact, we actively encourage a diversity of backgrounds, ages, and perspectives. See the
Joining Sugar on a Stick
page for instructions on how to get started.
What can you do?
There are three main ways you can contribute to the Sugar on a Stick community. We work closely with our upstreams,
Sugar Labs
and
the Fedora Project
.
Get Activities on the Stick
We're always looking for help with all aspects of the
Sugar on a Stick release process
. Here are a few things you can do:
Test Sugar on a Stick
and help us find bugs and think of ways the project could be better. When you find a bug or think of an enhancement,
file a ticket!
No technical experience required.
Help make it easier for others to test Sugar on a Stick by writing
test cases
.
If you've run a test case, you can write a test case.
Fix a bug or add a feature
to an existing Activity, to
sugar-core itself
, or to
Sugar on a Stick
. See
How to fix an Activity bug
and
How to fix a sugar-core bug
to get started.
Basic Python programming skills - or the desire to learn - are all that's needed.
Package Sugar Activities for Fedora
.
If you're a
Fedora Packager
or want to become one, help in this area is something we desperately need - it's a trickier thing to learn, but rewarding once you get the hang of it.
Review Activities for inclusion in the build
- check submitted Activities against our
Sugar on a Stick/Activity Criteria
and help us choose what gets included in the next release!
No prior experience needed.
Have an idea for a technical feature that isn't an Activity? Check out our
feature process
.
Get Sticks into Schools
Deployments all over the world need many different types of help as they work through the
Sugar on a Stick deployment process
- we need help building resources for all deployments to use, supporting those deployments, and helping new deployments start, as well as gathering stories and feedback from deployments so that we can make the next version of Sugar on a Stick even better.
Some things you can do to help:
"It's a wiki: Edit away!"
is often said in open source communities. Almost nothing is set in stone and can't be undone. So if you've got ideas how to make instructions clearer and more accessible, just go for it!
We produce official documentation such as the
Creation Kit
or the
Customization Guide
. If you've an idea how to make them better, why don't you jump in and create a patch? Creating these nifty text files is simple - instructions live in the
Documentation SOP
.
Unofficial documentation for unsupported workarounds for
installation
and
customization
need to be edited, tested, and submitted for approval for official support. Check them out and leave comments and improvements; just jump in and edit the page.
Interested in starting a deployment or helping a specific one (with anything from pedagogical design to technical support to funding logistics)? Introduce yourself on the deployment lists for
Sugar Labs
and
One Laptop Per Child
and we'll get you connected with some teachers on the ground.
We're looking for some people to help us assemble tools for our support team to use. Email the
Sugar on a Stick mailing list
if you're interested.
Get Contributors
Contributors are the lifeblood of the Sugar on a Stick community - we work hard to bring a playful mindset of teaching, learning, and meaningful work to the children we aim to reach, and we aim to keep that mindset in our own work and community as well. Welcoming and teaching new contributors or all types, building the resources they need, and teaching them how to empower others in their turn is one of the most important things you can do; it is
everyone's
responsibility to help build our community, one person at a time.
Some things you can do:
Edit this page and
Joining Sugar on a Stick
. Is there something we could do to make the "getting started" process easier? You don't have to ask permission to edit; just do it!
Help us fill in our remaining task-starter pages:
Sugar on a Stick release process
,
How to fix an Activity bug
,
How to fix a sugar-core bug
, and
Sugar on a Stick deployment process

Related work
While the projects listed below are not part of Sugar on a Stick, we watch them closely and try to work with them when possible (or at least we're trying to learn!)
For deployments lacking easy Internet access, one can turn a computer into a
Sugar on a Stick Creation Station
. The
Sugar Creation Kit
includes the materials you need to create Live USB sticks sticks and to install additional Activities, along with documentation and previous versions of Sugar on a Stick.
Older
portable Sugar distributions
based on other Linux distributions .
The undiscoverable
is an unofficial FAQ for tips, tricks, and solutions to common problems that may otherwise be tricky to find. These are being considered for inclusion in the official SoaS documentation.
