Notes
Passenger and Rails apps
Passenger has been installed to host Rails apps (mainly our inventory system). Its the first time I've installed Passenger via a package manager so I am not sure if it'll "just work". I need help from Bernie to package our inventory system (for Ubuntu) and give it a try.

This PHP webapp uses a MySQL db as backend. Nothing special about its config.
