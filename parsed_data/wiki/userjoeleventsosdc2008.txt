Sugar Organizer
Joel Stanley
(joel dot stanley at adelaide dot edu dot au) will be present.
Nothing formal is planned at this point.  Pia Waugh will be giving the closing keynote and a talk on OLPC.
I do plan on having some Sugar enabled laptops (Dell Mini, XO) for people to look at, and will give a lightning talk on SugarLabs.
