Overview
Get24
is an educational game intended for the OLPC created with the purpose of teaching children basic arithmetic and problem solving skills as defined by the New York State Math curriculum. 
In the game, users are given four numbers and must use those numbers and basic math operations to get 24, and each number can only be used once. The game is based off of the classic competitive math game,

Gameplay
As of now, when users derive at 24 using the current set of numbers, they will gain a point to their score for their success and a new set of numbers are generated.  They are also given a chance to skip the problem but will not earn any points. 
Adding a difficulty to each set and sorting them by levels is a feature that we plan on adding to creating a more structured experience to it.
