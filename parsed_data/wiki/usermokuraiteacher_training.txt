Peru and OLE Nepal have prepared teacher training materials in Spanish and Nepali that need to be translated into English and other languages.
2008-06-19 Waveplace has finished its beta "Squeaky Tales" courseware ... 30 lessons (with videos) that teach how to teach Etoys on the XO.   To see examples, or to become a beta tester, visit:

We took everything we learned in our first pilot (in the Virgin Islands) and started completely over.  The pacing is much better, as is the storytelling component, which was crucial in St John.  We're using the beta courseware in our three pilots this summer, and will then start completely over and make a physical textbook and DVD series (in English, Spanish, and French).  All will be sold at cost for physical materials.  (We're a non-profit.)
