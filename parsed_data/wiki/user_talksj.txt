Wiki barn-raising
I think it would be very helpful to harmonize certain functional elements between the Sugar Labs wiki and the OLPC wiki so that usage of certain devel-specialized wiki-text elements transfers easily from one to the other. I'm making a first pass at templates (and some categories) via facilitated copy-paste (see
User:Cjl/Sandbox
).  Thanks for the pointer to PyWikibot-building, which I'll study, but probably not master usefully anytime soon.
A more experienced Wikipedian (
hint, hint
) should tackle plugins and extensions as listed on
OLPC Wiki
, especially
traclink
,
iframe
, do you know anyone that could handle that?
