Look for at least one additional coordinator.
garycmartin
now a co-co-ordinator.
Contact former + current activity developers.
Wade
17:26, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
Ask about moving activities to git.sugarlabs.org (or mirroring).
Garycmartin
22:00, 25 May 2009 (UTC) still in progress
Ask about joining the Activity Team or coming to meetings.
Write guides for Activity Authors.  Pages should be located at Activity Team/Guides/Name.  Don't forget to add links to
Activity Team/Resources
.
Gitorious tutorial.  Overview of SSH key setup. How to create projects, make clones, request and accept merges.  Solutions to common problems.
Localization tutorial.  Intro to Python features, how to set up Pootle, deal with things like localizing images.
Posting tutorial.  Take the migrating from OLPC document and produce a guide to posting newly developed activities.
Documentation tutorial.  Guidelines for activity documentation, and perhaps instructions on how to create a FLOSS manual about your activity.
Integrate IMAGE from
User:Cjl/Sandbox
and add C (collaboration) and V (view source) and maybe a J (journal) or R (reflection) (CoVeR IMAGE)?
a.sl.o needs a "reading" or "literacy" or "words" category.
actually a.sl.o needs its categories reworked, could well turn into formal activity tags within the Sugar UI if we get it right

High Impact Tasks
These are tasks which will have a big impact on Sugar deployments.  This is your chance to affect thousands of children in the developing world!  This section will be updated frequently to feature the most urgent work the Activity Team has to do.
SWF activity launcher
Not directly related to Nepal deployment (I think), but Tomeu has been working on a gnash gtk widget called
SWFEdit
, there is some more information on his
blog
. I'll try to put up some demo activities and drum up some interest once I've had time to play!
Garycmartin
03:20, 26 May 2009 (UTC)
Thanks to Tomeu's work there is some examples now.
http://people.sugarlabs.org/~rafael/CuerpoHumano.activity.xo
Web activity launcher & framework - DONE!
Done - see
the tutorial
and
the git.
Other deployments are using HTML+CSS+Javascript to make learning activities, but they currently have to be installed using the Library Collection feature of Sugar which is not well developed.  We would like to build a 'web-activity' launcher script which allows Web based activities to be first class activities with icons on the home screens.  This would involve making a new framework out of the source code to the Browse activity and submitting it upstream to the Development Team, in addition to writing the launcher script.
In progress.  See
Karma
.
Maze collaboration
Maze is currently the most addictive multiplayer game on the XO, and it needs a further dusting of crack, including better statistics, handicaps, etc.
Quiz software
One of the top activity requests from deployments is a general purpose, collaborative
Quiz activity
.  It should support creation of quizzes by teachers.  It should support image, sound and text content, in the form of multiple choice, fill in the blank, true/false, etc.  It should allow multiple students to take a quiz simultaneously by joining the activity.
This project has been taken up by Tony Anderson.  He hopes to have an initial version done by Feb 22
.
I am still working on this - May 10 is current target date. Tony
Document Process to Add instruments to TamTam
See
Modifying TamTam
Sugarize Scratch
Scratch has a huge following. If Sugar was the best or easiest way to use Scratch it would help our adoption.  First step is getting it working on the latest version an put it up on the activity portal. Next is saving to the Journal and collaboration.
Infrastructure Tasks
Make activities.sugarlabs.org (or activities.sugarlabs.org) work.
See
Activity Team/Remora_port
.
Move projects owned by ATeam members over to git.sugarlabs.org and downloads.sugarlabs.org
See
Activity Team/How_to_migrate_from_OLPC
for activity migration instructions.
See
Activity Team/Activity Status
for a list of projects that need to be moved.
Bug IT to get us admin accounts for SL services.
Downloads.
Wade
21:10, 10 February 2009 (UTC) activities.sugarlabs.org will fill this need, for now we have to request individual accounts.
Trac (component creation)
21:10, 10 February 2009 (UTC) can create new components now.
Ask IT about activity repository mirroring.  A read-only Git repository on SL which automatically pulls from a remote repository.
We'll just ask authors to push a copy to Gitorious.
Flesh out structure for Activity Team wiki.
Wade
01:34, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
Create Activity Team wiki structure page indicating where content is supposed to go.
Wiki is doing pretty well now.
Bug IT to add helpful "git-clone" hints like on:
http://dev.laptop.org/git?p=activities/help;a=summary
and/or instructions for developing within sugar like: (snipped) I moved this snippet to the Get Involved page, and Gitorious does offer push / clone urls.
Wade
01:34, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
Development Tasks
Help SoaS and other distro packagers to get as many activities as possible working on plain Sugar (outside the XO software environment).
See
Activity Team/Activity Status
for a list of projects that need to ported and/or tested.
Clean up activities.  Bring .POT files up to date, check MANIFEST is correct, publish latest version to downloads.sugarlabs.org.
See
Activity Team/Activity Status
for a list of projects that need to cleaned up.
Build a list of "Rescue" activities: Ones which have not been worked on in a while but are close to being usable.
Build a list of "Help Wanted" activities: Great ideas or existing projects which need to be sugarized.
Generate spec for Web, SWF activities and deliver to Development Team.
Activity Feature Requests
This section is for feature requests for specific activities.  As requests, there can be no guarantee as to the order in which we will process them, but we will do our best.
If you are a new activity developer, there are many small tasks here which would be a great way to get introduced to the project.

Bug importer from trac.laptop.org to trac.sugarlabs.org
tomeu (w/m_stone's help)
We need to do the Big Move of Sugar bugs.  A one-time cost, fortunately.  Ed has agreed that the bugs in OLPC trac will be closed with pointers to the SL trac.

We need a very *very* high-level assessment of bugs to be moved over.  Basic, *basic* triage from knowledgeable developers.

We need a simple guide for people who don't know how to use IRC.  This should include (a) downloading clients for various OSes, and (b) using Mibbit, with screenshots. Connections via mibbit are no longer supported on freenode. You may wish to consider using
http://webchat.freenode.net
instead. Further information over at

Ongoing Tasks
People are needed mostly for writing and editing, but there are many other ways of making a useful contribution. For example, simply pointing out errors (such as typos, grammar and spelling, and technical errors) is an extremely useful way to help.
Fix spelling and formatting errors
Simplify the structure of long pages
Organize untidy pages so that they are easy to read
Fix broken links
Add new documentation to the wiki
Add category tags where appropriate
Before you start contributing to the wiki, you should read the
Wiki Guide
for information on how to edit pages correctly. See the **Wiki Cleanup** page for tips on cleaning-up wiki pages.
Cleanup
The pages listed on
Category:Cleanup
are in need of a thorough cleanup.
These pages either:
Do not follow the standards of documentation,
Contain incorrect or out-of-date information, or
Are formatted incorrectly.
Feel free to dive in. Tidy up a page and remove the Cleanup **tag**!
If you find a page that needs to be cleaned up, DO NOT add it here. Follow the instructions as laid out on the Tag page.
Organize
Much of our work is getting the wiki organized.  We look through
Special:Allpages
to ensure that content is in the correct place
Coordinate
Coordination between wiki.laptop.org and wiki.sugarlabs.org.
Move content between w.s.o and w.l.o so that it lands in the most appropriate place.
Expand
Want to contribute your knowledge?
As an open source Wiki, we have a wide range of individuals working to help expand our resource, and we want your help.
Check out the list of articles with the Needs Expansion tag for articles that are formatted correctly, but simply need to be expanded to cover the full topic.
See the Community
TODO
list for more things that need doing.
