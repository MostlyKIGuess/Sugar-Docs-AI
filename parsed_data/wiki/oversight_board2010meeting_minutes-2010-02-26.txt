Goals for 2010

It was expected that cjb and SeanDaly would draft some new TM and run it past the community for review. This was not completed, but nonetheless we spent most of the meeting discussing the merits of automatic vs manual issuing of licensing and problems of enforcement.
Google Summer of Code
It was just mentioned that Walter and Tim are working on our application.
