Introduction
Sucrose
0.84 is the latest version of the Sugar education platform, consisting of
Glucose
, the base system environment; and
Fructose
, a set of demonstration activities.
Sucrose is released every six months and contains many new features, improvements, bug fixes, and translations. Sucrose 0.84 continues this tradition and is our second well-planned release to date.
You can learn more about Sugar itself by studying the
Sugar definition
