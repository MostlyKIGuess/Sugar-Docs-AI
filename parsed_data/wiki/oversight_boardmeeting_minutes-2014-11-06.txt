Youth Summit
We did a post mortem on the .UY Youth Summit 20-23 September 2014. Kudos to Daniel Francis and Jose Miguel for a great event.
Trip Advisor
The Trip Advisor grant has been renewed, so we can solicit more translation/localization work (please contact cjl if you have a language you'd like to support) and more Turtle Art Days (please contact walter if you'd like a Turtle Art Day in your venue).
Google Code In
We agreed to once again apply for a position in Google Code In. Please contact walter regarding mentoring and tasks.
