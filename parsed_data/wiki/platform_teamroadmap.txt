Notes
postponed
ASLO-5, Migrate ASLO to the new AMO code base. SDK initial support.
Migration is postponed until upstream implement features ASLO needs, see the
migration progress
(green lines are parts that work on new AMO).
Shot-term goals
Activity Library related tasks:
polish the
Policy
(work with
Education Team
on an initial Policy),
start discussion on MLs,
land it.
Medium-term goals
Work with
Infrastructure Team
on the Central Login system to make it possible to be logged in only once while browsing Sugar Labs resources.
Develop an infrastructure to share logs on activity fails.
Develop an infrastructure to share anonymous usage statistics on Sugar Labs level, i.e., not only for particular deployment.
See around for ways how Sugar objects (Journal objects, .xol, etc) might be shared.
Long-term goals
The entirely Platform Team infrastructure should mature to be used in production mode on regular basis.
Status
2011 September report:
Constraints
The most [non-technical] critical constraints related to the Activity Library are a lack of editors and the fact that all active editors are software technology people. In other words, it would be useful to have a common strategy, created in cooperation with the Education Team, that covers such important resources as the
Activity Library
. And, eventually having educators as Activity Library editors.
Proposals
FRAM
based activities on the Sugar Labs wiki.
polyol
as a sugar-toolkit for non-Python activities.
