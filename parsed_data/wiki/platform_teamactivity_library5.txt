Roadmap
The upstream is in process of switching to new AMO code base, django based (python based framework). We need to do the same. So, the plan is:
Reimplement current ASLO patch to do the exactly the same in new AMO
Add new but not breaking current behaviour:
Upload by one click
Experimental support of
bundle-less
activities
The plan is having new ASLO ready for broad, pre-production testing,
until
2011-04-06
.
Upload by one click
The only that will be required is just uploading a .xo to the server.
All needed metadata will be fetched from the bundle:
activity.info, activity metadata in sweets recipe
specification
NEWS, release notes
po/, translation of activity.info fields
Bundle-less activities
Excluding network-less environments, the only thing anyone should know
about any activity, to run it from anywhere, is an unique Web url.
It is based on
0install
project. Network based nature, though, does
not mean the it will be useless w/o the net. It will be possible
to make selfcontained bundle by packaging activity itself and all its
dependencies to one .xo.
This is an initial support of
Sweets
on ASLO.
