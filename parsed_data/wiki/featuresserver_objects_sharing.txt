Summary
Share sugar datastore (Journal) objects on a standalone server.
The main purpose is having one place to share users Journal objects like
[1]
does for Scratch community (that doesn't exclude possibility of having storages for local community needs), i.e., having something similar to
Activity Library
but for Journal objects.

Detailed Description
Let users store sugar objects on standalone server. So, users can share theirs objects for broad audience.
The idea is keeping this feature as simple as possible from Shell point of view.
Utilize Browse for browsing/download/upload (?)
Minimal changes in Shell or even nothing (use Browse in all cases)
Server should return
object bundle
if web client is Browse and plain Journal entries otherwise (for non-sugar users)
Benefit to Sugar
Storing objects on a server, user shouldn't be online all time to share objects for other users. Users can treat server as a standalone additional storage as well.
Scope
depends on
Features/Object Bundles
Choose/adapt web framework
How To Test
Create a new Turtle Art activity
Upload the new entry to the SL wiki using Browse
Use Browse to download the entry back to Journal
Resume it from Journal
This should ideally work for all Activities, then folks can actually
start creating and distributing content/activities directly using
Sugar, for other Sugar users.
