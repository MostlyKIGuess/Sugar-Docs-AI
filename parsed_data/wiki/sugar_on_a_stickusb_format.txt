Title: Sugar on a Stick/USB format

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS A PROPOSAL AND IS NOT IMPLEMENTED AT THE CURRENT TIME!
Partitions should be set up as follows to maintain uniformity and compatability with all BIOSes, both those who support USB_HDD and USB_ZIP booting.
Partitions are to be aligned on 4MB blocks by using 32 sectors/track and 64 heads and using odd start numbers (counting from 1!)
MBR: syslinux MBR bootloader
partition 1: FAT16 (0x06), 32MB, standard layout, syslinux setup + kernel, marked bootable
partition 4: copy of partition 1 (yes, in front of part2!)
partition 2: ext3 remaining part of disk
Using fdisk, the above can be expressed as a session of:
