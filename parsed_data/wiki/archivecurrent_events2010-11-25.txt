1. The Oversight Board election is underway. We have a very strong candidate list that spans the breadth of the community. You should have received a ballot by email. Please vote before 29 November. If you registered to vote and for some reason you did not receive a ballot, please let me know.
2. Tony Forster continues to add to the [
Turtle Art with Sensors

4. Congratulations to Tabatha Roder and the NZ Testing Team who were honored by the NZ Open Source Awards 2010. Tabatha and the Saturday morning testers in Wellington and Auckland were recognized for their contributions to Free Software in NZ.
5. We have had a flurry of new activities being contributed by deployments. Ceibal Jam in Uruguay posted a number of their wonderful activities on ASLO; Yader Velásquez, a volunteer from Nicaragua posted a cool calendar activity (See
[1]
); and a 12-year-old student from Uruguay has posted two new activities: an image viewer and a Python development environment. Meanwhile, ASLO reports over 4.25 million downloads.

7. Aleksey Lim, Bernie Innocenti, et al. have completed the upgrade to the Sugar Gitorious server. Please note that the IP address for git.sugarlabs.org has changed to 18.85.44.120. And it has a new public SSH key:
4f:5e:5c:7f:ca:94:49:9d:2e:77:85:86:7c:de:56:f1
You will have to remove line with substring "git.sugarlabs.org" from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and then reconnect to git.sugarlabs.org in order to push changes to the server. (If you have trouble, check to see if "ssh-keygen -F git.sugarlabs.org -l" matches the key above.)
