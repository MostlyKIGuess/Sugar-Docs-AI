Title: Talk:Licensing
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Talk:Licensing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAFT of new Licensing text as per the discussion at the 9 June 2011 SLOBs meeting
Sugar Labs adheres to the principles of Free Software. An
overview of these principles
is provided by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has a
set of guidelines for Free and Open Source software
that characterize the intentions of our community.
All software and content distributed by Sugar Labs, including activity bundles uploaded to
http://activities.sugarlabs.org
, must be released under a license that conforms to the principles and guidelines referred to above.
You may use any license on the Fedora Project's
list of Good Licenses
or the FSF's
list of Free Software Licenses
. If you wish to use a license not on one of these two lists and believe that it fits our guidelines, please contact the
Oversight Board
.
This policy was determined during a
2009-12-11 board meeting
and clarified at the
2011-06-09 board meeting
.
Please contact the
Oversight Board
if you have questions about our licensing policy.
+1 to the above text from me!

+1 from Cjb, with the fix to one of the links that I just made.

The language seems sloppy to me. Fedora lists both good and bad licenses on the linked page, so saying "You may use any license"  from there is not quite what is meant. Secondly, the FSF link goes only to the GNU licenses, perhaps their
list of Free Software Licenses
is more appropriate?

Sorry. I realize I had the wrong link. Should be
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
which includes many non-GNU licenses. --

The problem with the Fedora link was a typo. Should link directly to
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Good_Licenses
now. --

Maybe just to be explicit, write "Good Licenses" instead of "acceptable licenses"?
Bert

Yes. I agree... consistency. --

Another nit pick: I find the second link to the GNU.org website distracting and unnecessary. I'd replace
"is found on the
GNU.org website
"
with
"is provided by the FSF"
.  The FSF is mentioned again later, so it's better to use the same name.

Nitpicking is right... but I made the changeÂ :) --

That's better, though I'd remove that link altogether. It adds nothing to the official Sugar Labs Licensing page. My suggestion was "is provided by the FSF", with no embedded link at all.

Sure... less is more. But I decided to spell out our acronyms when first used (and OSD->OSI) :P --

+1, having Fedora list of good licences will simplify workflow on ASLO to make it automatic, ie, activities-testing.sugarlabs.org
sees
to the
licence
tag in the
activitiy.info
to accept/reject any new upload.
