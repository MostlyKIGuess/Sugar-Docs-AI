--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugar toolkit now has support for Automated Activity Testing. This page lists the various aspects of Activity Testing.
The tests are supposed to be organized into the
tests
directory inside the bundle path. Inside this there are two subdirectories -
integration
and
unit
which contain UI and unit tests respectively. Both of them contain test files starting with
test_
. So the directory structure can be summarized as follows -
tests/
 |-integration/
  |test_operations.py
 |-unit/
  |test_functions.py
Only files beginning with test_ will be executed.
These tests can be executed using
./setup.py check
setup.py also takes a optional argument of which set of tests to run -
./setup.py check integration
./setup.py check unit
See the example
tests
inside Calculate.
