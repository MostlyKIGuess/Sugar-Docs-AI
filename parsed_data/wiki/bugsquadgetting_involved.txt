Join the Mailing List
Sugar Labs has not yet a dedicated mailing list to discuss bug related issues, we use the sugar-devel mailing list for the moment. It will be mostly used for announcements of events such as the triaging sprints and BugSquad meetings.

Start triaging
The BugSquad is a very welcoming clique. Best way to get started is by reading the
BugSquad/Triage Guide
and to join us at #sugar on irc.freenode.net or in one of our triaging sprints, see
BugSquad/Meetings
