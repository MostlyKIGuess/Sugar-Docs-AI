About Sugar
Sugar is a constructionist learning desktop environment that is an alternative to the ones typically used in Microsoft Windows, Apple's OS X or other GNU/Linux operating systems. It is conceived as a platform upon which children learn with Sugar
Activities
. The platform provides mechanisms for
collaboration
,
reflection
, and
exploration
. Sugar Activities cover a broad range of applications: browsing, drawing, composing, writing, programming, etc. See this
gallery of screenshots
.

MusicBlocks - A sugar Activity
Collaboration on Sugar
Introduction to the Sugar Interface
describes multiple full-screen views: a Home view, from which Activities are launched; a Neighborhood view, where learners can connect to each other through a
Jabber network
; a Journal view, which can be used as a
lab notebook
; and the Activity view, where Sugar Activities are run.
Sugar Activities have no Save menu: everything is saved automatically. While the interface uses very little text, additional information is revealed when the user hovers over icons.
Sugar is Free Software. It is developed in
Python
and runs on a
GNU/Linux
Kernel
, originally from the
Fedora Project
, and now from a
variety of GNU/Linux distributions
.
For an overview of the components composing a Sugar system see the
Sugar System Stack
.
Developers
: Those interested in developing Sugar software should visit our
developer documentation website

Or scroll down to explore more on the various possibilities of Sugar OS !
This section aims to be an introductory walkthrough of some of the methods of installing Sugar covered on the pages
Sugar on a Stick/Installation
and
Supported systems
.
Hardware requirements
1 GHz or faster processor
64-bit Processor
1 GB System Memory (RAM)
The Sugar .iso file from
Sugar on a Stick/Downloads
1 GB USB Drive (2 GB Recommended) or a Compact Disk (any)
A compatible USB or CD port (any)
USB Boot allowed on the BIOS (older PCs)
If your system requirements fall below those mentioned here, or you would like to check for alternatives, see
Detailed Hardware Requirements
Installing Sugar
Sugar can be installed as an Operating System installed on a Hard Drive, Live CD, or a USB Drive. Alternatively it supports almost all Debian-based and RHEL based Linux Operating Systems, and can be natively installed as a Desktop Environment. 
See any of the OSes in
#Getting Sugar
.
Sugar Live CD
The Sugar LiveCD contains a complete, functioning Sugar distribution and operating system on CD.
The Sugar LiveCD does not alter files already installed on your computer.  It returns to its previous state when the LiveCD is ejected and the computer is rebooted. The Sugar LiveCD allows you to temporarily run Sugar; this allows you to explore Sugar and test how Sugar runs on your hardware. Your settings will not be saved between boots, but you can experiment with inserting a USB stick into the computer running the LiveCD, and reading from, and saving work to, the USB stick.
Produce your LiveCD by downloading the Sugar on a Stick .iso image from
Sugar on a Stick/Downloads
and burning it onto a blank CD.
Many computers have built in software which will convert and copy, "burn", an .iso image to a blank CD. In Windows 8 from the File Manager, right click the .iso file and select 'Burn disc image' from the context menu, or use a free utility, like
ImgBurn
.
To run Sugar, insert your LiveCD into your computer and reboot into Sugar.
Sugar on a Stick
Sugar on a Stick (aka SOAS) is the USB implementation of Sugar for its portability and efficiency. There are many methods to create a SOAS. The downloaded sugar .iso from
Sugar on a Stick/Downloads
is then flashed (a bootable copying process) to a USB. For people who like GUI, there are Fedora Media Writer (Linux/Windows), UNetBootin (Linux, Mac, Windows), Rufus (Windows), etc. For command line interfaces, see
livecd-iso-to-disk
on
Sugar on a Stick/Installation
Sugar on a Virtual Machine
The advantage of a Virtual Machine (VM) is that, with the full VM documentation provided online, you follow that documentation to install the VM on your PC or Mac. VirtualBox
®
is a suitable choice of VM for a first attempt, see their website:
https://www.virtualbox.org/
As ever, download the Sugar on a Stick .iso from
Sugar on a Stick/Downloads
Open the VM, bind the .iso image to the VM and boot it.
All VMs have excellent documentation on how to boot an .iso and again it is covered on this page
Sugar on a Stick/Installation#SoaS on VirtualBox
and the method to make a Sugar on a Stick from your VM, is covered here
Sugar on a Stick/Installation#with Microsoft Windows
in Method 3, Launch a virtual machine with the Sugar on a Stick .iso file, then run the script, livecd-iso-to-disk
Projects
