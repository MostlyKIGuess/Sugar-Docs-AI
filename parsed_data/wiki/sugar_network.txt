Summary
Sugar Network is a content sharing and social activity, around this content, system for Sugar Learning Environment.
The system is intended to be a share point for various kinds of content within the Sugar community, e.g., friends, a class, parents, teachers, content authors, supporters, or, Sugar Learners in general. Sugar Network participants might be regular Internet users, students connected to a school server, or, even be in regions without any network connectivity except the
Sneakernet
.
The content itself might be Sugar Activities, artifacts created by Sugar Activities, books, articles, etc. Sugar Network provides a way for content creators how to share their work, and, a way for all other people how to use shared content as easy as possible. Sugar Network's social activity features should make this process smoother by providing functionality like getting feedback, issue reports, usage statistics, etc.
This work was initially started as an international research project within the Sugar Labs Perú in order to attend the needs identified during field work on Perú from 2007 to date.

Sugar Network integration in the Sugar Shell;
On XO laptops, use
one of the reference images
(note that images might be outdated, to make them up-to-date, upgrade system packages right after flashing). Or, try deployment
