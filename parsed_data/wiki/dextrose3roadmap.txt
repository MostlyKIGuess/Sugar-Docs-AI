Notes
Between releases, and atleast until Beta-2, we'll regularly release rpm updates for sugar and other dx related packages. The automated yum updater is supposed to update the releases accordingly.
Need to align with testing/QA. Community related emails need to plan around this roadmap.
All milestones listed will be communicated atleast via technical release emails on dextrose, sugar-devel, olpc-devel mailing lists.
