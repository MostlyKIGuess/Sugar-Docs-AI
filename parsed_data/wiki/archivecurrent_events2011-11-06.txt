Sugar Digest
1. Daniel Drake has announced the second release candidate of the new OLPC
11.3.0
software release, which incorporates the latest Sugar bits. You can download 'signed' images for testing from:
XO-1
XO-1.5
XO-1.75
The final release is scheduled for 1 November.
2. OLPC OZ runs a discussion website on yammer.com for teachers working with XOs in Australia. It is a nice source of feedback about Sugar and 1-to-1 laptop deployments in general.
Recently, there was a posting that referenced an
OLPC News article about a lemon-battery project
by Sameer Verma. There was also a tip of the hat to Guzman Trindad, a teacher in Uruguay, who built a
pulse meter
. I am not sure how OLPC News missed all of the other
great work that Guzman has been doing
with
Turtle Art and sensors
and also the
work of Tony Forster
, who
blogs
regularly about various ways to engage children with simple sensors. His most recent posting is about using the accelerometer on the XO 1.75 as a seismograph. Check it out.
3. While Guzman and Tony have been using the built-in sensors and simple sensors plugged into the microphone port of the XO laptop, the Butia team in Uruguay has been augmenting the XO with an Arduino board. The latest video of their work is on
YouTube
. Be sure to watch past the 'Schwarzenegger' robot to see the XO robot programmed in Turtle Art.
4. A few weeks ago, Team Sugarlabs participated in the Boston Hub on Wheels bicycle tour. Dogi road with an XO attached to his handlebars, but he wasn't running the Turtle Art odometer program.
