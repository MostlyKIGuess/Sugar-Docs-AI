The ultimate 'glue' that binds people is not 'what they get' from the Project, but 'what they can contribute' to the living communities served by their shared purpose.
Who?
An Ecosystem
Many stakeholders can be
key players
in the
One Laptop per Child
or
Sugar
projects.  The projects depend on volunteers taking on tasks from a wide spectrum of support opportunities by collaborating in education, technology, and outreach.  The inter-relationships of
key players
is represented in this Ecosystem diagram. Every picture or part tells a story.  You can trace 'links' from any element in the system to its influence on any other element. These reveal inherent iteration cycles. Repetition and practice lead to improvements.

Color scheme
I'm used to seeing neutral gray backgrounds that offset the Sugar-themed colors to highlight content categories.  --

I'm a little red-green deficient in my color vision, and I have trouble distinguishing the color groups on the diagram and key.  I think the red-brown tones in the overall background are causing interference with my perception of the soft green yellow fields. Brighter tones are not needed, just more independent colors --
