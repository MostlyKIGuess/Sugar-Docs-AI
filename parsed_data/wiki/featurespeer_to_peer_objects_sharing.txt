Detailed Description
Let users share their Journal objects with other users. The key difference from the "Send to" feature is that target users can browse shared objects without downloading them.
There could be several designs:
One set of shared objects
User can mark any object in Journal as a "shared" object, so other users can choose "Browse shared objects" option from buddy context menu in Neighborhood view and browse/download all shared objects (how, in what window?)
Collections
A superset of first option - collections of objects. In fact it relates to
Activities/Library
. User creates a collection of objects(they are "stored" in some way in Library object), later user shares this object, opening this object by other user means opening shared Library object (with list of shared objects).
Having collections makes sense in "local" mode as well - user can have several collections for local purposes, e.g., "My favorite books", etc. see
Features/Object Collections
.
Benefit to Sugar
