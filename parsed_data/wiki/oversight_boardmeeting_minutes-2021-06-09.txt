That's great! I think that the refactoring being the last large change of the 3 series is goosm
Good.

Hi Devin, glad you're here.
Devin Ulibarri
Happy to do MB lessons for anyone.
Chihurumnaya Ibiam
Hope everything is okay at your end.
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
And callaurrea we wrote a music version of the Dinensions game in Music Blocks. Tres cool.
Devin Ulibarri survived 2020, although it almost drove me crazy. Thankful to make it through what I hope was the worst of it. Thoughts and prayers out to all affected by the pandemic.
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
The kids all contributed  ideas and code to the project.
callaurrea
Hi Devin Ulibarri
It is great to have you here
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
I am guessing Mr. BIOS is not going to be able to join us. 
regarding Chihurumnaya Ibiam 's contract renewal, what would help is some input regarding priorities: what activities we want to focus on porting and supporting that are not yet packaged
maybe everyone can chime in by email?
(TamTam was one suggestion)
Chihurumnaya Ibiam
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
regarding
Chihurumnaya Ibiam 's contract renewal, what would help is some input regarding priorities: what activities we want to focus on porting and supporting that are not yet packaged
Agreed, besides tamtam and viewslides as they're two open PRs for that at the moment.
Will also be looking at fixing sugar-datastore and sugar-paint as they fail to build in Python 3.10 and F35 would come with it.
That's for SOAS.
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
Is the CSound support still available? I haven't used that library in a while.
Chihurumnaya Ibiam
Yeah it still is.
It was ported to 6.0 a while ago if I remember correctly. 
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
anything else tor today?
callaurrea
not from me
Chihurumnaya Ibiam
Nothing from me.
callaurrea
other than it is good to know people are well... 
llaske_
Nope
walterbender (@walterbender:matrix.org)
