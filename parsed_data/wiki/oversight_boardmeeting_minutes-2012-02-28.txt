Finances
Robert reported on the
SL finances
. He is using GNUCash to maintain a shadow copy of the books maintained by the SFC. He'll be making regular reports at our meetings hence forth.
SFC Agreement
Bradley led a discussion of a request from the SFC to modify the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement between Sugar Labs and Conservancy to include a 10% overhead on revenues. The revision requires a unanimous agreement of the board, so we will circulate it by email, as not everyone was present.
SL Website
John requested that we hire someone(s) to finish the conversion to the new website. He agreed to put together a request for proposals so we can solicit bids for the work.
GSOC
Walter reported that our application to
Google Summer of Code
was submitted. We are still recruiting mentors and project proposals.
