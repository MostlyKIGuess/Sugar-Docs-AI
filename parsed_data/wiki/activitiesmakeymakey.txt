Using MakeyMakey
While the activity is running, the OLPC-kbdshim service is stopped. When the activity is stopped, the service is restarted.
This is necessary because there is a conflict between the OLPC service and the MakeyMakey.
Note:
While the activity is running and the service is stopped, the game keys and rotate screen button will not work.
Note:
This activity requires
sudo
access. Alas, some Sugar distributions do not allow
sudo
access.
