"Manjaro ARM Preview2 for Raspberry Pi 4! (Manjaro ARM Team)
The Manjaro ARM project is proud to announce the second test release for the Raspberry Pi 4!
This is an indication of how far upstream (Raspberry Pi) is with 64-bit support.
This is also the place where you get a preview of the upcoming XFCE edition, that will be "replacing" the LXQT images going forward. Thanks to @Darksky for making the XFCE edition a reality!"

Branched fail GPG check  (not signed)
There is no f31 repo because we have not yet had a fedora 31 branched
compose finish. So, mirrormanager is pointing people to rawhide. This is
likely the cause of all problems related to f31.

How to Clear ./sugar
When making a new VM
, to clear the Sugar Journal of old entries and to avoid identity conflicts among copies of the VM, enter the command
rm -rf ~/.sugar
in the Terminal activity. Then shutdown the VM. This will clear all Learner information on the VM and let you start with a fresh install. Skipping this will result in collisions in the Neighborhood view of the Jabber network between separate copies of the appliance. Verify the presence of the
.sugar
directory by entering
ls -a
in Terminal.
When cloning a customized VM
, in order to keep the Journal and installed .xo Activities, use
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
in the Sugar Terminal, and then
shutdown the VM
. enter in root terminal:
su (password) shutdown -h now
This leaves the Journal entries and removes only the previous Learner's identity key files.
To clear the Sugar Journal
:
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/datastore
This may be needed if the Journal becomes clogged with too many entries.

it supports this IMHO essential feature. And livecd-creator typically
