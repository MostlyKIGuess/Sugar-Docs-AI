AWS Update
Qixiang is still working on FastAPI access. There's a PR open, Ibiam is waiting for him to respond to comments. Ibiam merged some of Kshitij's changes.
Open Tech Funding
The Open Tech Fund has two options may work for us:
https://apply.opentech.fund/user-experience-discovery-lab/
https://apply.opentech.fund/internet-freedom-fund-concept-note/
The former could be to improve accessibility for something like Sugarizer or Music/Turtle Blocks. The latter is more of a catch all.
Devin will investigate further.
Discussion of Elections
