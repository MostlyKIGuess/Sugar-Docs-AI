We confirmed the dates of the translation sprint: 20â€“21 October (the two days before the Peru Game Jam). We are waiting on confirmation of the location, but it will most likely be at the university. If you plan to attend, please contact

We discussed the pressing need for a

We'll be trying a LiveUSB deployment in a Boston Public School in order to fine-tune performance and document the process.
