Q2: distro endorsement v. neutrality
As discussed in
email
after last week's meeting:
MOTION 1:
Q2: Sugar Labs encourages all GNU/Linux distributions to package and distribute Sugar, and if possible will assist with hosting and infrastructure. SL Marketing may strategically decide to focus resources towards specific distributions in the interest of promoting Sugar more effectively.
Motion passes (7 for; 0 against)
Resolve outstanding Sugar on a Stick decision (Q3)
SoaS DP Q3: SoaS name
MOTION 2:
Yes, "Sugar on a Stick" should be reserved by Sugar Labs for use
by the SoaS-Fedora distribution so that Sugar can be marketed
effectively, until such time when a trademark policy, agreement, and
process is put in place: SoaS will be the first project to go through
that process.

Motion passes (5 for; 2 votes not yet tallied)
Further discussion of policy for using Sugar trademark
Lots of good discussion and we are close to some motions. To be continued.
(One topic that needs more fleshing out is the definition of "
substantially unmodified
" and its counterpart, "modified".)
Guidelines re transactions with the SFC
Walter pointed to
Sugar_Labs/Governance/Transactions
but we did not discuss the guidelines. To be continued.
Infrastructure proposal
We did not discuss Bernie's infrastructure proposal.
