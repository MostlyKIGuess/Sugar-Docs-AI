Hello!
I'm a
Fedora Ambassador
and the owner of Webpath Technologies in Rochester NY, USA.  I'm currently working on the Fedora OLPC SIG - particularly Fedora on SD card for the XO.  I'm also working with the
Rochester NY USA
grass roots group.
Feel free to contact me using webpath AT fedoraproject DOT org.
4th Grade Math
On February 8, the
Fedora Developers XO program
was announced.  This effort aims to get XO laptops into the hands of
100 developers who will begin work
on the
4th grade math curriculum frameworks
.
My personal contribution to this effort has been recruiting and as a liaison since I am not a programmer.
If you'd like to get involved, have questions about the Fedora and OLPC connection, don't hesitate to email me.
If you'd like more detailed information about this project, please visit the
Math4 page
