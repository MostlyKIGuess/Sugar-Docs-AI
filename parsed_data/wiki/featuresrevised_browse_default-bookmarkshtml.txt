Summary
What I am trying to Achieve:
An enhanced "start new" screen for sugar.browse in the fedora.spin-soas v4.
It should have a added customizable link and possibly Graphic Elements Suitable for
SoaS v4 Mango Lassi
Ideas from Soas #sugar-meeting: 06/14/2010
Idea Crystallization credits to mchua:, mtd and others.
This is the second idea we discussed
Proposed custom default page for SoaS v4 Mango Lassi
Summary: add new link 'Introduction:-Mango Lassi' inserted to the left of the existing 5 links.
The Use of a customized introduction page on the wiki is a part of this proposal.
List of proposed links (left to right)
Introduction:-Mango Lassi
Link to Custom wiki page
Special page on wiki with Needed Materials for using Soas-v4-Mango Lassi
This is a  way for teachers and users to access information from the wiki and other pertinent web sites.
Uses this link:
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Talk:Sugar_Creation_Kit#Introduction_to_Soas-v3_Mirabelle
- This will change for v-4

Make ASLOxo a separate Proposal
pbrobinson likes destination page now for Intro to Mirabelle
Must go into GIT for testing
In Git:

mtd: a customizable start page exists.
This is the first thing a SoaS user will see when the Sugar web browser is launched.  This is a critically important page.  I don't think we should accept anything until these groups have looked at it:
Existing SoaS deployments
Other sugar deployments
SL Marketing
Fedora Marketing (not sure if this is applicable)
At least as much thought should go into changing the page as went into creating it in the first place.

Meeting Log 07/05/2010:
[15:29:57] <mchua> #agreed Browse start page feature accepted - mchua is the feature sponsor
[15:30:17]
[15:30:40] <mchua> #info Implementation: genericize patch, push to upstream Browse, edit wiki pages it links to - use this as an example of the feature process, as it's simple but an obvious change
[15:30:51]
[15:31:01] <mchua> hm, "clearly visible and easily to understand" is probably better than "obvious" but anyway...
[15:31:24] <mchua> satellit__: so go ahead and move it to the "accepted" section of the features list, and let me know when you're going to be in Portland and we'll sit down and work on it then.
Detailed Description
In a discussion with Peter Robinson, I discovered that a custom bookmark Browse.rpm can be downloaded from the fedora repository.
I propose we use this fact to add a link on the startup page to a Customized Introductory page on the wiki for Soas with links to:
Instructions
Compatable Activities
Installation Methods
Floss Manuals
Pertinent links to pages on wiki.sugarlabs.org
Artwork -DVD/CD Covers etc
e-books (?)
Other sources of information (blogs/web sites etc)?
This should be a simple edit in Browse to point to file:///usr/share/bookmarks/default-bookmarks.html instead of file:///usr/share/sugar/activities/Browse.activity/data/index.html.
This allows a number of custom startup screens depending on the deployment or a schools requirements for Soas v4
Bernie has such a revised startup screen in his os240py software for the XO-1
This is the Proposed start screen
Use the existing Browse start screen and just insert one Custom Link
Introduction:Soas_Mango_Lassi
CLICK THIS LINK TO TEST:
http://people.sugarlabs.org/Tgillard/index14.html
This example will be changed when Mango Lassi becomes available
This looks like the most acceptable Idea
Discussion with mchua 06/16/2010 on #Sugar-meeting
I need to start a Git account
Make proposed changes in Git to file
http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/browse/repos/mainline/blobs/master/data/index.html
Suggestions on just what content should be included on this screen must be determined from discussions on the lists.
The Customized Browse index-html will be used for the build of the Browse.appliance in the v4 Soas-spin.
Benefit to Sugar
A simple enhancement to sugar.browse
MartinDengler
13:51, 14 June 2010 (EDT) In fact this is not an enhancement, it's a hack.  The browse homepage should be made configurable (perhaps via gconf) and have a sensible default.  In fact, you should do some research before you hack an app to pieces: this customisation is already possible and designed-for...see
http://cgit.sugarlabs.org/browse/mainline/tree/webactivity.py#n354
and
http://cgit.sugarlabs.org/browse/mainline/tree/webactivity.py#n162
.  The desired homepage should go in /usr/share/library-common/index.html .  Please can we do some research before we flail about doing stuff.  Sorry about the language but I don't have time to say this more nicely.
Scope
Revise the browse start new screen for Soas
(optionally) Edit the Browse activity to point to default-bookmarks.html or some other file specified by fedora
UI Design
Does the feature have a direct impact on the work flow, or does it need a UI? Link here mockups, or add detailed descriptions.

User Experience
If this feature is noticeable by its target audience, how will their experiences change as a result?  Describe what they will see or notice.
When Browse is started with
Start new
or for first time, this page will open. Custom content with links to web pages will be displayed.
Dependencies
What other packages (RPMs) depend on this package?  Are there changes outside the developers' control on which completion of this feature depends?  In other words, does your feature depend on completion of another feature owned by someone else or that you would need to coordinate, which might cause you to be unable to finish on time?  Other upstream projects like Python?
The advantage is that the Modified default-bookmarks file is updated from fedora in a normal way to Soas and is part of the build of v4
Fedora requires a .rpm packaging
Original Index.html is customizable.
Contingency Plan
Alternate path:
edit /usr/share/sugar/activities/Browse.activity/data/index.html
Duplicate with SugarClone, locally,for small number of customized sticks
Documentation
Is there upstream documentation on this feature, or notes you have written yourself?  Has this topic been discussed in the mailing list or during a meeting? Link to that material here so other interested developers can get involved.
Discussed with pbrobinson initially and mchua today 06/12/2010 on #sugar-meeting

Release Notes
The Sugar Release Notes inform end-users about what is new in the release. An Example is
0.84/Notes
. The release notes also help users know how to deal with platform changes such as ABIs/APIs, configuration or data file formats, or upgrade concerns.  If there are any such changes involved in this feature, indicate them here.  You can also link to upstream documentation if it satisfies this need.  This information forms the basis of the release notes edited by the release team and shipped with the release.
not a release in normal sense
