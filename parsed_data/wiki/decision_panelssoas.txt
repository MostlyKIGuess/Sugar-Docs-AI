Overview
A 12-person Sugar-on-a-Stick (SoaS) decision panel was appointed by a
September 25, 2009
Oversight Board decision.
The Oversight Board requested a final report, but none was received
by 2009-12-04
.  The Oversight Board then assumed responsibility for deciding the mandated questions (ibid.).  A summary
is below
.
Mandate
"Investigate the situation of how SoaS should be treated by Sugar Labs, and related questions, including answers to the following:
[Question 1] "Should Sugar Labs be a GNU/Linux distributor, rather than just an upstream producing Sugar releases?"
[Question 2] "Should SL be neutral about distributions containing Sugar, and refuse to endorse one over another?"
[Question 3] "Should 'Sugar on a Stick' be a phrase that SL asks its community to avoid using unless they refer to the SoaS-Fedora distribution?"
Any other question the Decision Panel deems required to provide an answer to the original question:"Is the current SoaS going to be the primary way Sugar Labs distributes a Sugar-centric GNU/Linux distribution?"

Executive Summary
The Decision Panel was
mandated
to answer three questions.  The Decision Panel's answers are below:
Question 1
"Should Sugar Labs be a GNU/Linux distributor, rather than just an upstream producing Sugar releases?"
Answer
Consensus trending towards
yes
.   There has been some discussion about what is involved in 'being a GNU/Linux distributor' and what the risks and benefits would be; specifics have been suggested but not clearly enumerated, making consensus building harder.
TBD - see below for opinions
Question 2
"Should SL be neutral about distributions containing Sugar, and refuse to endorse one over another?"
Answer
Consensus is
yes
.  There are requests for clarification of how SL can promote effective ways of distributing Sugar, and endorse all good distributions.
TBD - see below for opinions
Question 3
"Should 'Sugar on a Stick' be a phrase that SL asks its community to avoid using unless they refer to the SoaS-Fedora distribution?"
Answer
A plurality of people with definite opinions say
yes
, SL should ask its community to avoid using 'Sugar on a Stick' in a confusing way.  There is consensus that whatever name is used for common distributions should not be used in a confusing way, but disagreement over whether SOAS should refer to a specific distribution or a broad class of them.
TBD - see below for opinions
In addition,
the mandate
allows the Decision Panel to raise and answer any other question the DP deems required to provide an answer to the original question: "Is the current SoaS going to be the primary way Sugar Labs distributes a Sugar-centric GNU/Linux distribution?" (Question 0).
The Decision Panel has not raised any additional questions, outside of requesting clarification of terms in questions 2 and 3.

Report on Questions 1-3
Q1: OS distributor v. upstream
Question 1: "Should Sugar Labs be a GNU/Linux distributor, rather than just an upstream producing Sugar releases?"
Proposed answers:
Yes
No
Invalid
Undecided
Yes.   Without it Sugar Labs has nothing to encourage the use of or promote that is of direct use to anyone other then programmers or the people who assemble Linux distributions.
(reference)
counterpoint
.  There is real interest and are real plans to do this
(reference)
.
Yes. We greatly appreciate the work of those who have contributed to SoaS Strawberry and Blueberry.  We regard these products as valuable, critical distribution mechanism for Sugar, and we will do what we can to ensure their continued development.
(reference)
No, not now. SL is not now a full-service GNU/Linux distributor and being one is not in SL's
mission statment
; "
Sugar learning platform
" is *not* a GNU/Linux distribution.
counterpoint
counter-counterpoint
.  However many contributors volunteer to help with individual tasks thereof; and an official plan is part of a number of SugarLabs' members published plans.  Sugar Labs is better off spending its scarce resources on the
Sugar learning platform
.   Distribution work is is really hard and labour-intensive and being done by major distro vendors already (Debian, Fedora
(reference)
Invalid question.  An answer to this question is not needed for Sugar Labs' members to get on with their work, and the results from a decision panel will not have any effect

Undecided.  The two sides of the argument don't seem to be speaking directly to one anothers' issue

Q2: distro endorsement v. neutrality
Question 2: "Should SL be neutral about distributions containing Sugar, and refuse to endorse one over another?"
Proposed answers:
Yes
No
Invalid
Undecided
Yes.
No.  Sugar On a Stick, the Fedora-derived distribution, will be the endorsed distribution.  SL needs to influence the distribution so drastically that it is effectively controlling it
(reference)
counterpoint
Invalid question.  An answer to this question is not needed for Sugar Labs' members to get on with their work, and the results from a decision panel will not have any effect
ref
.
Invalid framing.  Sugar Labs should be able to endorse the best methods of distributing Sugar, and not feel their hands are tied with a need to endorse all distros, regardless of their quality, or of how prominent Sugar is in the distro.
Undecided: what do "neutral" and "endorse" mean?  We need to be more clear about these definitions in order to answer

Q3: SoaS name
Question 3: "Should 'Sugar on a Stick' be a phrase that SL asks its community to avoid using unless they refer to the SoaS-Fedora distribution?"
Proposed answers:
Yes
No
Invalid
Undecided
Yes.  Sugar on a Stick is the central pillar of our marketing strategy
(reference)
.  It's not trademarked, but should be
(reference)
.  SL does not want to confuse its users and a light touch like this is all that's needed
(reference)
No.
Invalid question.  An answer to this question is not needed for Sugar Labs' members to get on with their work, and the results from a decision panel will not have any effect
ref
.
Too specific a question.  Limiting SOAS to referring to a Fedora distribution is not necessary to avoid using names in a confusing way.
Undecided. While it's reasonable for SL as a community to have a "don't be confusing" policy that applies equally to all of its projects, that has nothing to do with trademark per se.

SL should support effective distros; this can be done neutrally.

The question is too specific.  I agree with both Ben and Sean, who feel they fall on 'Yes' and 'No' sides of the fence.

Conclusion
In the
absence
of a final report  the Oversight board decided
Question 1,
Question 2,
and
Question 3
:
[Question 1] "Should Sugar Labs be a GNU/Linux distributor, rather than just an upstream producing Sugar releases?"
Answer:
No
.  SL wishes to spread the use of Sugar and consequently works with GNU/Linux distros to produce and offer downloadable versions. This work can include helping to promote distros, and hosting them.
[Question 2] "Should SL be neutral about distributions containing Sugar, and refuse to endorse one over another?"
Answer:
No.
SL may promote one distribution in its marketing campaign, but encourages all GNU/Linux distributions to package and distribute Sugar, and if possible will assist with hosting and infrastructure.
[Question 3] "Should 'Sugar on a Stick' be a phrase that SL asks its community to avoid using unless they refer to the SoaS-Fedora distribution?"
Answer:
Yes.
"Sugar on a Stick" should be reserved by Sugar Labs for use by the SoaS-Fedora distribution so that Sugar can be marketed effectively, until such time when a trademark policy, agreement, and process is put in place: SoaS will be the first project to go through that process.
Any other question the Decision Panel deems required to provide an answer to the original question:"Is the current SoaS going to be the primary way Sugar Labs distributes a Sugar-centric GNU/Linux distribution?"
Answer:
Sugar Labs' intent to promote Sugar as widely as possible
means that SL will work with GNU/Linux distros to produce and offer downloadable versions. This work can include helping to promote distros, and hosting them.
Further ideas
discussion of potential naming conventions.
discussion of
how
to support products such as SOAS, and what that means
exploration of what it means to "produce a distribution", which some active contributors felt was a huge effort and others felt was already being done, with most effort happening upstream.  Better agreement within the community about what is being done may help avoid distracting meta-debates about direction.
