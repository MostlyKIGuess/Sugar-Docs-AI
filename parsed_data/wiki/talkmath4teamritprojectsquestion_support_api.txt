Flash Card Game - Assimilate
We do not have details at this point, but we can give you the ideas we have for Assimilate and the
API
.
As a flash card game, it will need to store text (and eventually pictures/graphics of some sort for geometry questions).
It would be nice to integrate it with the
Teacher Reporting Team
as well to be able to send data back to the teacher about the students progress.
We plan to have categories of flash cards so part of calling the function to get a flash card would be the category value.
