Teams status
Certificate program
Following up on a thread begun in mid July
[1]
the following motion was made:
Sugar Labs will award certificates to developers to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions to the Sugar Learning Platform. Several certificates will be made available, based upon the area of contribution.
The Sugar X Contributor certificate will be given to an individual who over the course of a sustained effort contributes to some Sugar community team, e.g., Sugar Translation Contributor. (The teams are listed on the wiki). The specific criteria for certification will be determined by the team coordinators, but in general, it would involve a repeated effort on behalf of the team's goals at a high level of quality (e.g., of quality sufficient to be incorporated into our offerings).
As an example, the Activity team will issue a Sugar Activity Developer certificate to an individual who develops at least one Sugar activity that is subsequently posted on the Sugar Activity Library and be of sufficient quality to be approved for public release. The activity must also include internationalization, including the submission of a POT file to the Translation Team, and documentation, including the creation of a page in the wiki under the Activity category. As will the Contributor certificates, sign off will be made by the associated team coordinators, in this case the Activity team.
The motion passed 4 votes in favor, no votes opposed
