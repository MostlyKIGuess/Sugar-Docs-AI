Sugar is run in a window on some systems.
For some ages of learner, a full screen is better, to avoid distractions.
To run Sugar full screen:
Go to the menu Applications -> Education -> Sugar,
Drag and drop the Sugar icon to the desktop,
Right-click on Sugar icon and choose Properties,
Change the command to:
/usr/bin/sugar-emulator -f
Notice
In Fedora 20 and later, sugar-runner replaces sugar-emulator.
By default, sugar-runner runs full screen.
Use the desktop icon instead of the menu to start Sugar,
To exit Sugar, select the Logout option from the XO icon in the centre of the desktop.
