Overview
Story Builder is a graphical story constructor tool. Drag & drop a variety of characters (stamps) into a background, and create an imaginative scene. Simple word-processing capability is included to encourage and facilitate free-form creative writing and the saving of original stories. When finalized, users will also be able to add their own images (created with Paint, Camera, etc.) and share their stories via the mesh.
This is a WorldWideWorkshop project - see the
