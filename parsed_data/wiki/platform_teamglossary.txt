A systematic approach to supporting the full cycle of discovery, learning, collaboration, and development within the Sugar Learning Platform ecosystem. Harmonic Distribution consists of software, services, and practices that make interacting within the Sugar community more useful and complete. Harmonic Distribution consists of two major parts, the
Sweets Distribution
and the
Sugar Network
.
Sweets Distribution
A set of repositories that provide base Sugar software within heterogeneous environments including the most popular GNU/Linux distributions and hardware platforms within the Sugar community. Sweets Distribution provides the easiest way to launch Sugar and start exploring the rest of the Sugar related content using the
Sugar Network
.
Sugar Network
A system that is designed to share within the Sugar community different kinds of content, e.g., Sugar Activities, artifacts created by Sugar Activities, books, lessons, reviews, comments, questions, etc. It uses
social network
mechanisms, to setup relationships between community members intending to improve Sugar Network content. The Sugar Network consists of one global server and an arbitrary number of distributed servers to support people who don't have direct access to the global one, e.g., due to lack of Internet connectivity.
