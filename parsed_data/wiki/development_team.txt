Outdated
When Sugar Labs was very large, we found it convenient and effective to divide into teams.  This was one of the teams.
Mission
The mission of the Development Team is to build and maintain the core Sugar environment.  This includes specifying and implementing new features in conjunction with the
Design Team
, fixing bugs as they are found by the Testing team and the Sugar community, and generally making Sugar awesome in all ways.
Meetings
The development team had regular IRC meetings on Tuesdays at 5PM ET (22UTC) in the #sugar-meeting channel of irc.freenode.net (See the Sugar Labs
calendar
). One could find out more about the meeting time and upcoming and earlier meetings
here
. Help:
Using IRC
Team lead
The Development Team coordinator position carried administrative tasks such as organizing regular meetings, keeping the TODO list updated, keeping the development team membership list updated, and making sure that the team had clear goals and was kept focused.  We were accepting nominations for an election for this position, see
Development_Team/Team_Lead_Candidates_2010_05
, but the position is now open.
Releases
See the
Development Team/Release
page.
Release manager
We have defined the role of the release manager for the past 3 releases as the following:
Making sure that the
Features/Policy
is followed by submitters,
Completing a formal test before release,
Making releases.
Schedule
A schedule was based on
GNOME releases
, a 6-month release cycle.
Now, releases are scheduled in an ad-hoc manner if at all.
Development systems
All of core Sugar development except system-dependent modifications can be done on a standard computer by
installing Sugar
.
Activity (aka application) development can be done in many environments using pre-compiled
packages
("sucrose") or
images
("starch").  For example, see
Debian
,
Ubuntu
, or
Fedora
.
See also the now unmaintained
Platform Team/Sweets
technology.
Document your work
See
Features/Feature Template
for an example.
Code review
Patches to Sugar are more than welcome. There are guidelines for
code review
to get them accepted.
Package Sucrose for your distribution
Currently there are efforts to maintain Sugar as part of
Debian
,
Ubuntu
, and
Fedora
.
Help us maintain good communication with distribution packagers to assist in this. Join the
Platform Team
.

0.114/Testing
