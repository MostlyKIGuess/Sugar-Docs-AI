Manuq started the port of the shell branching the
hippo removal
.  The
main issues
were identified by Daniel Drake some months ago and fortunately most of them are fixed at this point.
Daniel Narvaez set up a
sugar-build branch
to make the port.  To test:
git clone
git://git.sugarlabs.org/~dnarvaez/sugar-build/manuqs-shell-port.git
That is sugar-build with this sugar components branched:
