Bugs/Fixes
Bugs
Problem
Fix
Rotation
Blocks Warp when Rotating getting bigger the more you do it
The Fix we derived for this will be that the blocks do not physically rotate only then numbers get passed around
Rotation Variables
Rotation variable are using place holds should be more dynamic
Concatenated the string didn't work but casting it to str worked
Sprite Lag
Seems like there is redundant code in the works causing lag in the movement
The blocks are now frozen to mouse. No more sprite lag
Screen Size
Screen is at the moment not dynamic should be changed to be full screen and dynamic for no problems in the future
Screen resolution has been changed to XO native resolution
Sprite Size
They are too tiny at the moment make bigger ...
Everything is bigger now. Much more easily readable
Grid
needs to be dynamic and not a png image
Program randomly generates a board of individual squares so its no longer a png image.
Snap to grid
Snapping to grid still happened even after a block was released elsewhere
Added a check to check if there was a block currently moving when snap to grid should occur
Dragging switches target
When dragging a block over another block, you could start dragging the other block instead. This depended on which block was created first in the code.
Another check that only allows dragging to start if a drag isn't currently occurring
Individual Rotation
Only One Block can rotate make it so that any block can, maybe visual cue like a rotate symbol on a block
Each individual block on screen can now be clicked and rotated.
Elements on Top
Certain elements that should be always on top aren't. Sometimes some blocks become on top. This has something to do with how the sprite rendering works.
Changed render mode to Layered Updates.
Cursor Transparency
Cursor Image isn't transparent where it needs to be even though png image itself is.
Used image.convert_alpha
Load a board dragging
When loading in a pre-constructed board, blocks cannot be dragged.
Included the editMode boolean check
