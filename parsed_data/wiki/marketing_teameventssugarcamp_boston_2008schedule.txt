Presentation day
See
Marketing Team/Events/Sugarcamp Boston 2008/Proposals
for the list of proposed talks, by speaker.  Speakers are encouraged to fill in below with more details on what you plan to discuss or leave out, so that attendees can lobby you to change your mind!
Hour-long "topic" slots will probably be given 15 minutes per speaker, with 15 at the end for questions and discussion.  For half-hour "person" slots, it is suggested that the speaker plan a 15-20 minute talk and leave 5-10 minutes for discussion, and 5 minutes to handover to the next speaker.
