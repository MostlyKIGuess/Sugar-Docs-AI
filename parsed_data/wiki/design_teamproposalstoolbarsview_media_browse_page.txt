Browse page toolbar
Rationale:
The 'Eye' icon can be easily confused with the Record media activity. It might be re-purposed generally for media controls, and the view controls moved to the activity sub-toolbar. --

Alternatively, more room on the Browse main toolbar could be achieved by providing a
page sub-toolbar below
.
Media toolbar
Browse page toolbar
This new composite toolbar would provide page-related controls, e.g., search, undo/redo, copy/paste, shrink/enlarge, full screen, show bookmarks.
It would do away with the 'Edit' toolbar that had the 'Cut' (scissors) as an icon (but no cut action).
The trigger for this is simply hover or alternate click. The outline down-arrow is a possible new hint for this behavior.
Standard click would Reload as normal.
