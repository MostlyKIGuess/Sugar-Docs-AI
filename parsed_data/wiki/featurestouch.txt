Targeted release:

Last updated: 21.08.12
Percentage of completion: 30%
Detailed Description
We have several items that can be changed in the current unported shell, like bringing up Frame device palettes on left click. Furthermore there is work to be done in regards to Gestures. Support for this will happen in the toolkit-gtk3 so it can be used in Activities and for global gestures in the shell. A detailed list of items that will be done is tracked under
Features/Touch/Development
.
Proposed plan of action
Some of the items can be done in the GTK+ 2 based shell (e.g. Palette behavior). These changes are already underway.
At the same time the
Shell is ported to GTK+ 3 and PyGObject3
. Features like Gesture are dependent on that port. They will be done when the Shell port has landed.
