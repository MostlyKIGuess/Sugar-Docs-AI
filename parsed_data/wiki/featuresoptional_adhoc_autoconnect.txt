Detailed Description
This proposal is based around the needs of the OLPC project in Australia, but reflects a common need (current or future) of other OLPC implementations as well.
The problem:
Having hundreds or thousands of sugar clients creating or connecting to these adhoc networks by default is not necessary a desirable behavior, specially considering that only a few of these are actually using collaboration.
The proposed solution is to provide a system configuration so this behavior can become optional and not mandatory as it is now.
Benefit to Sugar
Make Sugar friendlier with the spectrum and save device battery.
Scope and implementation
The implementation can be found in
here
. The changes are:
include a new configuration to sugar settings.
check this configuration value before auto-connecting.
This implementation will preserve the current behaviour by default. Deployment will be require to use the configuration in order to disable the auto connect policy.
User Experience
The new configuration will preserve the current behaviour by default, therefore the user experienced is untouched.
