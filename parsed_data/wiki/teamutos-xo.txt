The
Utah Open Source Foundation
is sponsoring once a month hackfests for the OLPC (XO) 4th Grade Math's Curriculum.
The UTOS-XO team has a
mailing list
to coordinate local activities and development.  We encourage status updates to continue to be on the 4gm mailing list.
So far, we have 11 members of our team.

We will probably divide this team into two geographically located teams for convenience.  Salt Lake and Utah counties tend to be good choices for team borders.  If more folks start appearing north of Salt Lake County, it's possible to splinter a little more.
