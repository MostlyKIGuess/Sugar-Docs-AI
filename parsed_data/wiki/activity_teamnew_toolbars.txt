[done] make share button insensitive, icon for logsend (could be edit one)
I'll pick up this one --
Garycmartin
Looks to be done already in latest git, but reveals a new sub toolbar issue in that it does not conform to the standard height (it must be relying to the height of share/keep icon) --

Note that the sub toolbar is not the correct height once the two buttons have been removed.
How about this as tools icon rather than the source view currently used?
here's the mock-up
Another option (ripped off Walter's cockroach bug icon)?
here's the mock-up
Terminal
close icon on tab
tabs not distinguishable
Are we moving session tabs to the top as we put in the new toolbar? Perhaps we should focus on the toolbar for now, and worry about the current tab style later. I would like to see tabs in the same style as Browse for consistency if possible (should make the tab names shorter to make tabs more usable). Regarding toolbar, the "Tab" tab can go and all functions fit in the primary toolbar, will need new (tab shape) icons for "New tab" and "Close tab" perhaps also "Previous tab" and "Next tab" though we could consider removing these --
Garycmartin
OK, how about these two new icons (likely want them in sugar-artwork so other activities can use them)
and
?
And potentially
and
?
Also potentially need a primary tab toolbar icon
Here's a mock-up for how the above may look using tab shaped buttons --
Garycmartin
Browse
tabs not distinguisable
[done] move edit and vew icon to the left
TA
keep as options
keep eye out for a better 'keep/save/export/import' type primary toolbar button
save snapshot
Read
readtoolbar icon? (bookmarks one?) No palette for star icon
maybe the bookmark ones can go into the top bar?
open unsupported document (_load_document l540)
alert?
can I reload a document?
Memorize
play/create icons? How to switch between the two modes?
How about this for create (with all play tools in primary)
here's a mock-up
Labyrinth
view, edit, the rest of the options go into the primary one
bug: copy when no text is selected (type clipping)
I'll pick up this one
Garycmartin
Calculate
icons for algebra, trigonometry...?
How about this for generic algebra icon
a tough one, here's a mock-up
How about this for trigonometry
here's a mock-up
And boolean
here's the mock-up
Imageviewer
view section only? all the view related things in the main line?
Jukebox
view section, rest in the main screen
Pippy
simple activity (hello world example)
can we put the "Stop" and "Run" button controls in the primary toolbar to give more canvas space? --
Garycmartin
Paint
paint: edit, image (eye), color icon, shape icon, text icon, tools icon? (or main one?), effects icon
Record
use type (audio, video etc) icons
Physics
everything in the top?
how to differentiate the activity close button and the play/stop one?
do we actually keep the stop button?
I'll pick up this one --
Garycmartin
Typing turtle
simple one
Playgo
everything in top, restart button from memorize
Infoslicer
new concept (currently edit and library tab)
Write
some icon polishing and a reorder
Some misc mock-up ideas from Walter
and
Possible replacement "Insert Image"
Primary toolbar icon for the secondary toolbar of bullet styles
here's the mock-up
Paragraph heading 1 style
Paragraph heading 2 style
Paragraph heading 3 style
Paragraph heading 4 style
Paragraph block text style
Favourite attempt so far at an icon for the "Plain Text" paragraph style
Here's another try at an icon for "Plain Text" if you don't like above

is the 'x' icon correct or should it better be '-'?
