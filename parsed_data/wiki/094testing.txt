How to contribute with testing
It is very important to get feedback during the development cycle to fix bugs as early as possible and to get a stable release at the end. The order of stability depends among other things as well on
you
.
If you find bugs please report them into the
Sugar Labs bug tracker
indicating the 0.93.x version in the ticket version field. If you have hardware from OLPC you can use one of the current development builds for testing:
os3
for the i686 architecture (XO 1 and XO 1.5) and
os41
for the new ARM hardware (XO 1.75). Hardware specific bugs especially with the new 1.75 hardware please report at the
OLPC bug tracker
. The current development version is as well available in
Fedora 16
and
sugar-jhbuild
(sugar* master branches).
