This page aims to inform anyone interested in contributing to Sugar documentation.
This page acts as a "Landing page" for those who have read "How to edit Help and contribute" in XO Help, and to encourage others to test it.
Any updates to the technical contents of that page will be announced here. Please see

XO Help Contents
Mallard
How does this effort support Mallard? Please see also
Documentation_Team/Notes/1.0
Pages written in reStructuredText can generally be read in Yelp, with a few errors.
Wish list for new documentation
Compare with the old content, and check if something is missing
http://dev.laptop.org/~gonzalo/old_help/XO_Introduction.html
Keyboard
shortcuts
- not yet well covered.
Please add any item you see missing.
Please add your ideas
This version of Help allows us to have an open mind about how Help documentation evolves, depending on the content provided by contributors.
What ideas can be added to improve XO Help?
Sugar features page
An experimental page was produced quickly before Help 17 was published.
The current content is View source and Say selected text. This section is hoped to expand.
Please add undocumented features.
New to Sugar pages
Entry level contributions are particularly welcome.
There is the possibility of modifying some pages, so that towards the top of page one finds "entry level" links to compact topics like :
navigation
function keys
frame
add features and tools, which are needed for competent use of Sugar.
Please add your ideas
Collaboration
It would be good to find a model for collaboration. It might be possible within the Sugarlabs system to upload a
help_page.rst
for multiple editors.
Any suggestions welcome for a repository for "Documentation - work in progress".
The paragraph
Documentation Team/Notes/1.0#Activity documentation template
demonstrates a model for collaboration. Here the wiki page for Portfolio,
Activities/Portfolio
, was edited into the preferred format, and then lifted straight into "the documentation project".
Where wiki pages are suitable for transfer to Help they could be highlighted here.
How to get freshest Help sources
To see work in progress since the previous XO Help, this command:
git clone
https://github.com/godiard/help-activity.git
you will get the Help Activity _with_ the sources included.
You can install it in your development environment doing:
cd help-activity
./setup.py dev
(if you have the activity already installed, uninstall it first)
Now you can modify any .rst file in source directory or the images in the images directory,
and to create the html files, you only need do:
make html
In Sugar
You don’t need to restart the activity to see the changes, can do click
with the secondary button, and select reload.
In any other Linux environment
The output directory
html/
, and is opened by opening
html/index.html
in a browser, so it is easy to see the changes as you work.

Known issues
Not fully documented
a. If work you have done seems to have corrupted Help,
b. or in the event you wish to make changes to the index, over and above, adding a new line to the bottom a table of contents as described in the tutorials,
you may delete all the output files, that is,
~/help-activity/html/
and
~/help-activity/doctrees/
. They will be regenerated by
make html
.
Reconfigure Help to show View source
In Sugar as we already have a View source button in the Frame.
If you are working with the Help software in a browser, you can add a
View source
button, which will appear in the navigation panel. You need to alter three lines in
~/help-activity/source/conf.py
. Each of the entries listed below comprise a comment line, starting with a "#" followed by the code line. Find each pair of lines in
conf.py
and change the value in the code line like this.
# Custom sidebar templates, maps document names to template names. ## Edit: Sugar default is without 'sourcelink.html'
html_sidebars = {'**':['localtoc.html', 'sourcelink.html']}
# If true, links to the reST sources are added to the pages. ##Edit: Sugar default is False
html_show_sourcelink = True
# Do not copy .rst files ##Edit: Sugar default is False
html_copy_source = True
A disadvantage of doing this is that extra folders are created, which might be confusing at first, and the duplication of files can make it difficult to correct certain mistakes. The command ``make html`` also takes longer to run. It is recommend not to make these changes before you are confident navigating the source and HTML folders.
