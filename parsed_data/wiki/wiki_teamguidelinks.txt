You cannot use HTML anchor tags to create hyperlinks, but you don't need to.  In fact, just typing a URL will make it an active external link in the text.  For example:
http://www.cern.ch
produces a link to CERN.
There are two general types of links,
internal
links to an article (page) in this wiki, or
external
links to some other web site.
Internal Links
Internal links are links to an article or section in an article in the same wiki:
