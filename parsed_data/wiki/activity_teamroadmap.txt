2011 September report:
1000 downloads of 1000 activities
It would be awesome if the Activities Team could grow the
Activity Library
enough so that by Sugar Labs' second year, Learners were to download at least 1000 Activities 1000 times.

High quality core activities
As a contrast to the above, the Activities Team should help a core set of high value activities reach and maintain a quality condition; to act as exemplars for new authors; to demonstrate the benefits of including core Sugar features; to provide robust tools/environments that learners and teachers can rely on.
