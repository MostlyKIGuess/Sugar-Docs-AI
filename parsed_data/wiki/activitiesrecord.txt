Overview
Record is the basic rich-media capture activity for the laptop. It lets you capture still images, video, and/or audio. It has a simple interface and works in both laptop and ebook mode. An interface for sharing pictures among multi XOs during a picture-taking session is a hallmark of the Record activity.

If the camera is recognized, a device /dev/video1 will be created.  You may need check using Terminal.
The internal device is usually /dev/video0, but this is not guaranteed.
To use a external camera, you can apply this patch
diff --git a/glive.py b/glive.py
index 9f8c5fa..d2207e7 100644
