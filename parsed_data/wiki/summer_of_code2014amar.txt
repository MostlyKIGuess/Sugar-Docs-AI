Hello Sugar Labs,
Myself Amar Sharma, an undergraduate 3rd year studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna majoring Computer Science and Engineering. At Indian Institute of Technology Patna I have gathered strong theoretical background in courses like Computer Organization and Structure, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and many others.
At IIT Patna I have developed proficiency in C, C#, Java, ADT and C. I am currently involved in a project under Innovation Centre, IIT Patna titled “Smart card Access System” which uses power of RFID technology and Raspberry Pi processor to grant access to Innovation Centre. I also have successfully organized several events and have helped many students in completing their projects apart from myself taking part in several projects.
Majorly I have worked only on closed source projects for academics and non-academic purposes this is first time I have gain interest towards Open Source. Hoping to learn new skills in programming with this experience.
