In case no one noticed, there's an updated version of Surf
[1]
. It has a lot of features the previous Surf lacked, such as downloads, persistence and history. It's still missing cookie support because libsoup has no static python binding.
In order for this version of Surf to reach feature parity with Browse, it would (only) need a PyGI(-compatible) version of sugar-toolkit. It should work just fine with gtk2.
