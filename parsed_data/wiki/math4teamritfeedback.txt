See this
Teaching Open Source wiki page
for a critical review of the first (Spring 2009) version of the Honors Seminar and following Sugar Summer Program for Co-ops.
Please consider setting these Activities up for localization in Pootle as part of completing the project.  A downloadable activity is good, one that can be localized into the 100 or so lanugages hosted in the
Sugar Labs / OLPC Pootle server
is great.
