FEDORA based Live USB devices
Cautions with using Live USB devices
Wait for delayed writes to the USB device to finish (up to 15 seconds) before pulling it out of the system. If writes do not complete, you will corrupt the USB device file system and it will not boot.
If you do a yum update on a small USB device, you can overload the persistent overlay.
[3]
"Fedora 10 adds the 'reset_overlay' option that you can pass on the kernel command line which helps to recover." See
LiveOS image
,
Talk:Downloads
, &
this page
for more discussion of storage economics.
Use a larger device (4 GB or even 8 GB), if you plan to do updates or install new programs.
If you use a 1-GB device, do not (i) install large updates or activities or (ii) download large files.  The 300-MB overlay will quickly fill up (e.g., within an hour), and your device will become corrupted (i.e., unbootable) without any warning.  You may use the
Sugar Cellar
utility to monitor the usage of the persistent overlay. Also, check your Journal free space frequently.
Use zyx-liveinstaller
Sugar_on_a_Stick/ZyX-LiveInstaller
for soas-v2-
Blueberry
or
liveinst
command for Fedora based installs in a terminal to make a non-live installation. It will require about 2x as large device as the file structure will not be compressed. These non-live installs are more robust in use but may have a shorter service lifetime (See
olpc:How to Damage a FLASH Storage Device
.)
Fedora 13-based SoaS-
Mirabelle
will install with either
liveinst
(Anaconda) or
zyx-liveinstaller

Hint:you can also use:
livecd-iso-to-disk
[5]
or
liveusb-creator
[6]
[7]
to create the device.
NOTE:USB used with liveusb-creator needs to be labeled "FEDORA" for liveusb-creator to make a bootable USB
notes on ext3 / ext4 file systems:

(It looks like ext3 formatting may be more robust.)

dd command from terminal (
non-persistent
)
You will not be able to store anything on this USB. (It will be new each time you start it.)
[root@localhost Desktop]# dd  if=soas-i386-20100329.19.iso of=/dev/sd(*)
954368+0 records in
954368+0 records out
488636416 bytes (489 MB) copied, 128.247 s, 3.8 MB/s
[root@localhost Desktop]#
NOTE Important to get name of USB device correct VERY DANGEROUS IF WRONG
type "mount" in terminal and look for /dev/sd(*)  ie: sda,sdb,sdc.....
It will disappear the next time you remove the target USB and enter the command again.
liveusb-creator from command line in terminal
(
using Fedora 12
)
a- Open terminal and type:
liveusb-creator --reset-mbr
b- Move slider "Persistent Storage ( )MB" - to set size of USB Persistence file
c- Select correct  "Target Device" (the USB you want to use)
d- OPTIONAL: To find your USB enter command "mount" in terminal. look for /dev/sd(x) with description of your USB
e- select the .iso file you plan to use "Use existing Live CD"
f- select "Create Live USB"
livecd-iso-to-disk script
takes a downloaded soas.iso file and writes it directly to a USB stick
Download script:
livecd-iso-to-disk.sh
to your Desktop
Right click on the script file in your file manager, and change the file properties to allow executing the file as a program.
Place the source.iso file on your Desktop.
Enter command "mount" in a terminal. Look for /dev/sd(x) with a description of your device. Use the correct device node, /dev/sd
?
, in the script.
Hints:
Use a text editor to write the command line for the script, and review it for correctness. Then copy-paste it into the terminal. (safer)
See
LiveOS image
for ideas on optimizing your storage choices.
(--overlay-size-mb 800 sets size of persistence file.)
Delete this option if you want a device with non-persistent storage of changes.
Use "--overlay-size-mb 300" for 2-GB devices
Be advised about changing the device file system format in

Warning: The kernel was unable to re-read the partition table on /dev/sdb (Device or resource busy).
This means Linux won't know anything about the modifications you made until  you reboot.  You should reboot your computer before doing anything with /dev/sdb.

USING 8 GB Installer USB
1-) liveusb-creator
Boot from new USB
Terminal
liveusb-creator
select MyFiles and xxx.iso
insert target USB
set persistence ( slider will not move?)
Create Live USB
shut down installer USB
wait for delayed writes to USB target (2 min)
Boot from new USB
NO Persistence why?
2-) Use livecd-iso-to-disk to write 2 GB USB=
cd /media/Myfiles

Details and How To
Note1: you may get a "not enough room on device" message when you dd this .img to a 4GB USB but but the .img is really only 3GB is size and should work.
Note2: liveusb-creator will NOT work in this USB as this in not a live system.
Note3: This is  modified version of bernie's

Notes:(revised 4/29/2010)
after SugarClone Script revision
Adding Script to USB
http://people.sugarlabs.org/fgrose/SugarClone
1-)
BOOTED live soas USB:
in sugar root terminal:
su
cd /mnt/live/
wget
http://people.sugarlabs.org/fgrose/SugarClone
.
OR
2-)
Live soas USB inserted and opened on another PC
download
http://people.sugarlabs.org/fgrose/SugarClone
to PC
Right click on Properties/Permission and check allow executing as a Program
Copy and Paste into opened USB on Desktop. (This is the /mnt/live/ directory on the USB when it is booted and running)
Make Clone Custom USB
Insert Target USB
In the Terminal Activity of that running SoaS image, enter the command:
/mnt/live/SugarClone
Script will show you what USB's are present and proceed to write to the one you select.
SugarClone script will be present on all sticks that are created by the first custom stick with all of the customizations you have done to the master.
Target USB will prompt for Name and Color on first startup as this information is not preserved.
great way to make a customized spin for special uses
