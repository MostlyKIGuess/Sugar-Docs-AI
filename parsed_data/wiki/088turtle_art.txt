Introduction
Turtle Art is an activity with a Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on snap-together visual programming elements.
Turtle Art is intended to be a stepping stone to the Logo programming language, but there are many restrictions compared to Logo. (Only numeric global variables and stack items are available, no lists or other data-structures. The conditionals and some of the functions only take constants or variables, not expressions. Limited screen real-estate makes building large programs unfeasible.) However, you can export your Turtle Art creations to Berkley Logo. The
Arduino fork
of Turtle Art also has a facility for sensor input, so, for example, you can move the Turtle based upon sound volume or pitch.
Turtle Art is in the same tradition as Etoys, Scratch, Lego Mindstorms™, and Lego Microworlds™.
Turtle Art is used extensively in Sugar deployments and numerous materials for support in the classroom have been developed. Of course, since Turtle Art is a Logo derivative, many of the classic Logo exercises are well suited for engaging students in Turtle Art. For example, Tony Forster has been
blogging about a wide variety of Turtle Art activities
. Gonzalo Odiard has written a
short introduction to Turtle Art
.
Turtle Art will let you export your project as PNG, HMTL, SVG or Logo. In other words, you can use Turtle Art to make presentations and as an SVG generator.

What is new for developers
Raúl Gutiérrez Segalés and I completed a major refactoring for 0.88 which includes a block factory--a more object-oriented approach that should facilitate a more decentralized development approach.
Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)
added fi, hi
Compatibility
Compatible with all versions of Sugar although some functionality is lost with pre-0.82 versions and sharing is incompatible with previous versions.
