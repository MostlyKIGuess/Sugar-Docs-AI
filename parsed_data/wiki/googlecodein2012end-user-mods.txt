Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/End-user-mods
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/End-user-mods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
We have an existing mechanism for duplicating and modifying Sugar activities: a copy of the bundle can be creaed in ~/Activities, where it can be modified by the end user. We also have a mechanism for viewing the Sugar toolkit source, but no such convenient way for making changes without risking messing up the system. While it should be easy enough to make a duplicate copy in the user's home directory, and to change the Python paths to use the modified code, we need some mechanism -- presumably at boot -- to choose which version to run: the installed version or the modified version.
Task
Design a mechanism for making end-user modifications to the Sugar toolkit (and possibly Sugar itself).
