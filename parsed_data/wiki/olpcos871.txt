XO-1.5 ON LOAN FROM OLPC

Testing
Start Browse before jabber connection:
Starts on first try
Connect to Apple Network Airport Extreme AP WEP ASCII
Network ADD Jabber.sugarlab.org
only see shared activities NO Avitars
This may be a known bug in sugar 0.92.2 where the jabber gets overloaded with present and past Avitars from users. (I have seen >200 on screen) eventually only shared activities are displayed
http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/2845
http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/2897
This does not occur in sugar 0.88.1
>Download IRC-10.xo from Browse Home (OLPC Activity Library/Activities -ASLO?)
Note: Failed to start on first try
15 sec grey until return to F3; works on 2nd try
Activities only start on second try
(get "failed to start" on first try)
(This is related to a by a dbus timeout in Soasv4 and v5)
it takes about 15 seconds for a response.Including exiting an activity.
Suspect This delay with dbus timeout error seems to be related to jabber connection
Start IRC-10.xo: Failed to start on first try; works on 2nd
