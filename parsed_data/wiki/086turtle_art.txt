Introduction
Turtle Art is an activity with a Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on snap-together visual programming elements.
Turtle Art is intended to be a stepping stone to the Logo programming language, but there are many restrictions compared to Logo. (Only numeric global variables and stack items are available, no lists or other data-structures. The conditionals and some of the functions only take constants or variables, not expressions. Limited screen real-estate makes building large programs unfeasible.) However, you can export your Turtle Art creations to Berkley Logo. The sensor-enabled version of Turtle Art also has a facility for sensor input, so, for example, you can move the Turtle based upon sound volume or pitch.
Turtle Art is in the same tradition as Etoys, Scratch, Lego Mindstorms™, and Lego Microworlds™.
Turtle Art is used extensively in Sugar deployments and numerous materials for support in the classroom have been developed. Of course, since Turtle Art is a Logo derivative, many of the classic Logo exercises are well suited for engaging students in Turtle Art. For example, Bill Kerr has been blogging about the experiences of his students trying to tackle Barry Newell worksheet of 40 geometric shapes to be rendered using turtle graphics.

What is new for users
The most visible change is the incorporation of the new Sugar Toolbar design.
Turtle Art v65 with the 0.86 toolbar design has the project buttons: Hide Palette, Hide Blocks, Erase, Run, Step, Debug, and Stop Buttons, and four submenus
The activity toolbar contains the Keep Button, Snapshot Button, Save to HTML Button, Save to Logo Button, Save as Image Button, and Load Python Code Button
The edit toolbar contains the Copy and Paste Buttons
The view toolbar contains the Fullscreen Button
The help toolbar includes the Sample-Projects Button and hover help
File sharing of Turtle Art projects from the Journal works between Sugar "buddies"; but only through a local connection, i.e., Salut (See
Development_Team/Release/Releases/Sucrose/0.84#File_transfer
)

What is new for developers
The good news is that contributions are coming in from multiple sources. In particular, many thanks to Raúl Gutiérrez Segalés, who has contributed many patches. Raúl and I are working on a roadmap for a major refactoring for 0.88 which will include a block factory--a more object-oriented approach that should facilitate a more decentralized development approach.
Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)
We now have support for:
mg
ta
Note:
The artwork will be reworked once the translation team completes its work.
Compatibility
Compatible with all versions of Sugar although some functionality is lost with pre-0.82 versions.
