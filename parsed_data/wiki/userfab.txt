Fabian Affolter
My Name is Fabian Affolter and I'm living in Berne/Switzerland. I'm no longer one of the packager who tries to bring as much Sugar activities to Fedora as possible. Perhaps I will start packaging Sugar activities in future again but for now there is too much frustration around in the Sugar development. Sorry.
