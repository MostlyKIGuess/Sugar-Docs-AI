Locale Groups
If a new locale has been added, you can create a new group for accessing that locale in the Editor CP by:
Go to the Groups Manager
Click Create Group at the bottom
Group Name: {locale} Localizers
Access Rules: Localizers:{locale}
Anyone placed in the group will have write access to {locale}
Other Groups
For details on access rules, see the
Remora Permissions
page, but in summary:
Permissions are assigned in the form of Controller:Action, so Developers:add would give permission to the add() action of developers_controller, although some controllers are public and don't check access rules (such as the developers controller)
A * grants access to all actions, so Editors:* grants access to everything in the Editor CP
*:* grants access to everything and should never be assigned to anything except the admin group
There are some "fake actions" that are used, generally identifiable by their capitalization:
