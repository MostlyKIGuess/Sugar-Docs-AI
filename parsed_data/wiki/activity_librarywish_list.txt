Just like Activity comments
Nicknaming it SAL instead of ASLO
And personify SAL, the
librarian
, as a new century librarian of Sugar Activities.
This would be friendlier to children and teachers, and further distinguish our library from the Mozilla origins.
What about naming it simply:
Library
,
Sugar Library
, i.e., without any acronyms at all.

There are befriending and marketing advantages to a nice nickname. Developers will use shorthand regardless, and sal is shorter and easier to pronounce than aslo. As children advance to developers, they will recognize their friend's name in use by the adults and maybe feel like, wow!, I would like to do that too.  There are lots of Salvadors, Sallys, Salvatores, Saleems, etc. who would take note. And we could even spins some legends about the serious activity leader who appropriated the software to build our library, and the Siberian A L who is keeping it working, and the South American and Aotearoan librarians who are working on curation. --

Improvements in L10n annotation
It would be good to know if an activity has been internationalized and set up for localization, whether is is hosted in the Sugar Labs Pootle instance or elsewhere.
