Description of problem:
For 17 Beta RC4, the KDE Lives are too large:
Fedora-17-Beta-i686-Live-KDE.iso : 754974720
Fedora-17-Beta-x86_64-Live-KDE.iso : 752877568
Confirmed fixed with RC4.1:
Fedora-17-Beta-i686-Live-KDE.iso : 718274560
Fedora-17-Beta-x86_64-Live-KDE.iso : 715128832
All other size and checksum tests pass for RC4.1 as well.

bcl> adamw: I'm headed for bed. But we can easily turn off including the macboot.img in livecd-creator and lorax.
<adamw> bcl: we're going to just do an rc4.1 spin with 17.4.
<adamw> since 17.7 doesn't actually boot anyway (you confirmed that), it's winning us nothing.
<adamw> and we've had a lot of testing with 17.4-generated images, so it seems safest just to go back to that.

If I write F17 Beta RC4 desktop live to USB with dd, boot from it via BIOS
mode, and try to do an installation, it does not succeed. At bootloader
installation stage it pops up the 'there was a problem during bootloader
installation, the system may not be bootable' warning. Indeed, on reboot, the
system is not bootable - grub reports 'error: file `/grub2/i386-pc/normal.mod`
not found. Entering rescue mode...' and gives me the rescue prompt.
Working theory - this is due to grub2-mkconfig getting confused by the macboot
stuff on the USB stick. (Yes, it scans the USB stick). grub2-mkconfig run just
ends with it claiming it's found OS X on the USB stick, and then it exits with
