While Sugar Labs DC is in the early stages of formation, we already meet most
of the "necessary conditions" as laid out on the
Local Labs
page:
A university connection as a local human resource
Sugar Labs DC will have the new
Governor's Career and Technical Academy in Arlington
as an educational partner.  Since the GCTAA is a joint project between
Arlington Public Schools
and
Northern Virginia Community College
, possibilities will be open for vertically integrated projects involving software written by students at GCTAA being used with APS elementary and middle school students.
A local pilot user group from which to learn
Sugar Labs DC grew out of the
OLPC Learning Club
, so it is organically linked to a pilot user group.
A local passion or sub-goal that provides a rational for the work
Faculty and students in Arlington Public Schools have an active 10 year involvement with the
Python Programming Language
and Python community. The list of projects in which we have been involved include:
*
Turtle Art Site
*
Guido van Robot
*
Open Book Project
*
Graphics API for Students of Python (GASP)
*
Python Bibliotheca
*
Sugar Labs DC/Online Activity Sharing and Publishing
Bi-directional communication with the global Sugar community and other Sugar Labs
Sugar Labs DC will be working directly with our partner projects in Chalatenango and El Calvario, El Salvador, and we will always be looking for synergistic relationships with other communities around the globe.
A sustainable and well-defined entrepreneurship model
Sugar Labs DC will function as a project of the OLPC Learning Club, and with the Learning Club will seek relationships and support from the many educational, scientific, and governmental organizations located in our capitol area.
A program to reach out to local free-software community and local industry
Sugar Labs DC organizers are already active members of the local free-software community, and are particularly involved with the
DC Ubuntu LoCo Team
.
