Users oriented
The following features are oriented to end users.
Default configuration changes
The following changes were made in the default Sugar Shell configuration.
Registration on school servers is disabled by default
Sugar Shell support registration on OLPC XS school server. Sweets Distribution does not provide OLPS XS, and this functionality is disabled by default. To revert to the original behavior, set the
/desktop/sugar/show_register
GConf key to
true
.
On initial start, Sugar Shell will ask for a user nickname. To revert to the original behavior (when Shell reuses the system user name), set the
/desktop/sugar/user/default_nick
GConf key to
system
.
