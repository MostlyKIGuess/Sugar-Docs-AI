Detailed Description
There have been efforts to gather statistics from the Journal as well as from Sugar error logs. However this is not sufficient. We would like there to be an optional logging of user interaction events that would make statistical analysis of usage viable.
Benefit to Sugar
Sugar will benefit from being easier to work with for researchers trying to study computer in education implementations. Also deployments can engage in user experience tracking and help provide helpful (hard data) feedback to developers who can improve the platform.
The Local Lab in Peru sees this feature as strategic for Local Labs sustainability.
