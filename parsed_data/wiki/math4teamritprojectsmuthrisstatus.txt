Muthris is a math themed, Tetris-based game inspired by Cuyo. Players control falling blocks which must be grouped in certain math related ways in-order to clear that grouping from the board.  The level is lost when the board fills up with blocks.  Players learn math skills by fun repetition of simple mathematical problems and the grouping of sets of numbers.  Levels are abstracted away from the core game.  This allows one to simple drop in new levels and learn different mathematical concepts.
