Targeted release: 0.108
Last updated: 7/July/2015
Percentage of completion: 40%
Detailed Description
Gtk.Menu palettes (namely, clipboard and journal) are hard to maintain and theme.  They should be removed.
The only reason they are used now is because they support nesting of menus.  However, a modal could be used instead.
Benefit to Sugar
This will make sugar easier to maintain and reduce the amount of visual bugs.
Scope
Adding a modal should be a quick process.  It would probably only involve:
Adding a modal primitive to sugar3.graphics.modal.SelectorModal`  (DONE, patch:
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-toolkit-gtk3/pull/238
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-toolkit-gtk3/pull/249
)
Migrating the 2 users of the Gtk.Menu to the modal and Gtk.Window based palettes
The clipboard in the frame (DONE, patch:
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/pull/551
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/pull/567
)
The journal palettes

User Experience
Users will no longer have the open with sub-menu.  This means that they will have to move their mouse more.  However, the search bar will make life eaiser for power users as they can jusotsearch and press <enter>.
Users will notice that palettes look more beautiful, as they are not Gtk.Menu based.
