Customize your own remix of Sugar on a Stick.
We realize that we'll never be able to create an Activity selection suitable for all deployments. Quandong now includes a set of teacher-tested Activities in the default image. The following links point the way to building alternative customizations.

Sugar on a Stick is a Fedora Spin.
Sugar on a Stick is recognized by the
Fedora Project
as an official
Spin
.  These close ties with Fedora's release cycle and resources from their engineering and marketing teams extends the reach of Sugar on a Stick and makes the project itself more sustainable. In exchange, users of Fedora have access to an easily deployable implementation of the Sugar Platform; it's a great example of a mutually beneficial upstream–downstream relationship.
Contributing to Sugar on a Stick
The team recognizes the need to continue to improve its release processes and engineering sustainability. New contributors are urged to get involved and help us move towards our long-term vision of bringing stability and deployability to Sugar's personalized learning environment.
If you'd like to contribute to the next version, due for
release
in December of 2012, please join our
mailing list
, review
Sugar on a Stick
, and visit
Sugar on a Stick/Beta
. All types of contributions are welcome, from the technical to the pedagogical, and we're happy to teach what we know and learn what you have to share.
Thank you to all the people involved for their awesome work!

QA
Much thanks to Peter Robinson who did a majority of the work to program, prepare and coordinate the work with many other sugar developers for this release.
Thomas Gilliard did field-testing (building real SoaS sticks from .iso files and testing on those) - it's the closest thing to systematic testing we've had yet, though we still have a ways to go.
Thank you also to James Cameron in Australia for his testing help!
Much help was also provided by the team at #fedora-qa; freenode IRC

Documentation
A new release of documentation should come out with each new release of SoaS (although resources have prevented this).
The Fedora-site documentation may not be an improvement over our Sugar Labs, ad hoc wiki documentation methods, as the tools needed to participate are more complicated, and the Spin page documentation is not open to editing.  The Fedora Sugar on a Stick pages have not been edited since Mirabelle was released in May 2010.
The attempt to better support a small number of known, working, "how to set up SoaS", instructions has not yet been fulfilled.
