Chris Daniels
I am a 5th year Software Engineering student.  I enjoy computing, Formula One, ice hockey and percussion.
Development Interests
Most of my experience is with Java but I have had a lot of coursework using C and occasionally C++, Scheme, Ruby or Python.  As a software engineering major, my interests are in software architecture and modeling, design patterns and requirements engineering.
In terms of the math curriculum, I am interested in the Number Sense and Operations section.
