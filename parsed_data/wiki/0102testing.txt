What Should I test
Even though some general testing is required to detect regressions, it is important to give special attention to the new features. Some of these features are:
Gender and Age in About Me control panel section.
Limited number of activities and instance of activities that can be opened at once.
Displaying icons on the Update control panel section.
Rework of Network control panel section.
Labels for Web Services control panel section.
Layout of Languages selection method in control panel section.
Filters toolbar in the Journal.
Notification system to display messages from system and activities.
Features/Notification System
Sound adjustment options in the frame, to adjust microphone.
Identify external volumes (eg USB drives) by colors.
Testing with a XO
We have created images with the latest Sugar 0.102 sources. These builds are "clean" Sugar Labs images, which do not include any customization.

Installing
These images are NOT signed by OLPC, therefore you need an unsecured XO for installing these images. To save some time, you can use
this tool
.
XO-1
Copy the file 41002SL0.img and the file 41002SL0.crc to a USB device.
Boot your XO with the USB device and the charger connected.
Go to the ok prompt: At boot time, briefly type the Escape key (top left on the XO keyboard, with a white X in a black disc) when you hear the startup jingle. Do not hold it down. In a few seconds, the FORTH ok prompt appears, along with a hint on help.
Type
copy-nand u:\41002SL0.img
when flashing is finished, you will get the prompt again, type reboot.
XO-1.5, XO-1.75 and XO-4
Copy the file 41002SLx.zd to a USB device. (Every model has a different x number, check above.)
Boot your XO with the USB device and the charger connected.
Go to the ok prompt: At boot time, briefly type the Escape key (top left on the XO keyboard, with a white X in a black disc) when you hear the startup jingle. Do not hold it down. In a few seconds, the FORTH ok prompt appears, along with a hint on help.
Type
fs-update u:\41002SLx.zd
when flashing is finished, you will get the prompt again, type reboot.
About the SD images for XO-1
These images are a development of James Cameron, to help improve the performance on XO-1 devices.
To install these unsigned builds, you may use fs-update on an XO-1.5, XO-1.75, or XO-4, and then move the SD card.
Alternatively, this Open Firmware fragment:
http://dev.laptop.org/~quozl/z/1XCG63.txt
can be added to the top of
the
41002SL0.zd.zsp
file, and then
manually loaded from the ok prompt:
ok fl u:\41002SL0.zd.zsp
This will then read the 41002SL0.zd file and store it on an SD card.
Later versions of olpc-os-builder can add this fragment.
