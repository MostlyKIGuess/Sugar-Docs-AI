Detailed Description
Currently in Sugar, a user can capture a screenshot by pressing 'Alt + '1' combination and as a result the Journal save that screenshot by the default naming convention - "Screenshot of X".
With this modal dialog, the user could specify the name for that screenshot by providing a string in the text box beside the preview icon.
Benefit to Sugar
User can now specify names to snapshots and later remember why they took it.
