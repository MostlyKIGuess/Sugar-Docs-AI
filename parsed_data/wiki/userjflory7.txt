About Me
I'm a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology and majoring in Networking & Systems Administration. I intend to graduate in 2019. I am extremely passionate about free and open source software and I try to champion it anywhere I can. As part of my time at RIT, I plan to pursue the
FOSS Minor
as part of my degree.
As part of the Spring 2016 Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software Development (HFOSS) course at RIT, I worked on
PyCut
for my group's final project.
I'm generally idling somewhere on IRC around the clock, so if you see me, feel free to ping me and say hi!
