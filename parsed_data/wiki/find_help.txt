Sugar Labs FAQs
There is a compilation of
frequently asked questions
(FAQs)
indexed by category.
Discover
the undiscoverable
We have tried hard to make it easy for children to
discover
what they can do with Sugar software without being told. But that isn't always possible. So on
The Undiscoverable
page we have a list of things that teachers should know about, and be able to demonstrate. If you find some feature of the software incomprehensible, please add it to the list, and we will see what we can do for you and everybody else who runs into the same problem. Sometimes the answer is a click of the mouse away, but not always. We are, after all, introducing children to all of human knowledge. They will inevitably need help with much of it. It took all of our ancestors many years to get this far, so it is alright if children spend a few years hitting the highlights, and getting help to do it.
