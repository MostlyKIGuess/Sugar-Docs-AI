These are the Internet services maintained by the Sugar Labs
Infrastructure Team
. Machines are documented under the
Machine
hierarchy. Multiple services can run on the same machine and, in some cases, one service could span across multiple machines.
Please help us refactor the infrastructure documentation to match this new layout. If you own a service, it is your responsibility to maintain its documentation current.
