Detailed Description
So far we know inside an Activity if it is able to be shared or not because the share button is changing it's state accordingly (the button is made insensitive if the activity does not support collaboration). But there are other places that need to be aware if an activity supports collaboration or not. For example the buddy palette in the neighborhood view where you can invite a buddy to your activity. An invitation should only be possible if the activity supports collaboration.
Benefit to Sugar
It will be clearer to the user if an activity can collaborate or not.
Implementation plan
I propose to add a field to the activity.info file. This field should be named 'can_share' ad takes the values 'yes' and 'no' (like the 'show_launcher' field). The default value that is assumed if the field is not set will be 'no'. The reason here is that the activity maintainer who cares about collaboration sets the field and there are more activities that do NOT support collaboration than there are who do.
Scope
The shell and the toolkit has to change, furthermore the activities that support sharing have to change their activity.info file.
UI Design
No UI design involved.
