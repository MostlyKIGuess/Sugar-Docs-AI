Some visible changes in F1 view:
* the number of buddies should be increased from ~20 to 70-90
  some Sugar versions (maybe 0.90-0.92) don't publish information about
  nickname/colors on regular basis; this information are being stored on disk for now
* for some buddies, server still don't have information about colors (replaced by gray) and nick names (jabber ids)
* Neighbourhood view will show non-Sugar contacts (balck&white colors)
  that might be useful, e.g., to start chating with them using Chat activity

A Listing of the Activities in sweets_distribution:Factory
Detailing which activities work.
<alsroot> : not all activiites will work, only ones that don't have external deps and are pure python.
this development stage running all activities is not a priority.
it is in early development stage, ping icarito and kaametza, they are developing client side application

The general rule for 0.94 and 0.88 repositories is using activities only
from [Sweets Distribution] packages and only for Fructose. The rest of
activities need to be handled manually, e.g., installing missed
dependencies.
In other words, 0.94 and 0.88 repositories are restricted in case of
activities (in some meaning it was just a proof of the system).
Only new system (right now in Factory repository) will cover full cycle
(activities [itself] will be handled out of native packages, from Sugar
Network).
But right now, Factory is not ready for more or less regular usage. So,
for regular usage choose 0.94 (or 0.88), avoid updating Fructose activities
from ASLO (excluding only pure python and without dependencies) and use
them only from [Sweets Distribution] packages.
I've updated the Wiki:
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Community/Distributions/Sweets_Distribution#Activities
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Platform_Team/Harmonic_Distribution/1.0/Todo#0.3
Hint: If you download a non working activity from ASLO:
Delete it in list view of Home (f3) --right click on it in listing.
sudo sh sweets-distribution sync
This reinstalls original activities
