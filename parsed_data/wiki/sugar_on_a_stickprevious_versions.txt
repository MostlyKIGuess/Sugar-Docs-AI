SoaS installation variations
A collection of install methods
Installation test Cases
Fedora 17 Test Cases
A Non-Live (uncompressed file system) image
This is an example of a dd writable SoaS-v2.img file which produces a fully functional Conventional install on a USB. This is equivalent to a liveinst install to USB disk.
It was first suggested by bernie in early 2010 as a better alternative to the currently used live USB SoaS file systems with their fragile and limited sized overlay,
This functionality is expected to be included in Fedora 18.
This can also be realized by entering
"liveinst"
in root sugar terminal.
This is the
Anaconda
installer for live file systems which installs to the USB disk with a normal install.
Approximately 2 times as large a USB stick is required (4 GB minimum) as a compressed file system and an overlay are not used.
