While
Sugar on a Stick Ubuntu
is out-of-date, the
Ubuntu
page is not an updated version for
Sugar on a Stick Ubuntu
.
The original Sugar on a Stick project was more than a way to demonstrate and install Sugar.  The pilot deployments were based on the most inexpensive USB storage devices (in order to include the poorest populations) and the idea that the Sugar Learning Environment could be carried in the learner's pocket from home to school to after school venues, such as libraries and clubs, where collaborative Sugar Activities could be resumed without loss of content and participation, see
Sugar on a Stick/Essence
.
Ubuntu Sugar Remix was an attempt to use the Ubuntu Live CD technology to address some of the technical challenges experienced in the Fedora-based pilots.  While the experiment was halted, there is value in learning from this experience and seeking new solutions.  --

I agree that the version of sugar available from the Ubuntu Repos mentioned below uses an outdated sugar 0.90 is the latest that is available.
This was a buggy release but it works with
surf-115.xo
as a browser
drag & dropped
from a USB. --
