Look at this tutorial:
Sugar_Network/Tutorial
* The possibility to launch Base Software in heterogeneous
  software and hardware environments.
* Using Base Software, provide access to various Content
  (Sugar activities, artifacts created by Sugar activities, books, etc.)
  created within the Sugar community.
* Using Base Software, provide collaborative functionality to
  support Social activity around the Content.
* Instruments and workflows to adapt Content and Base Software
  to specific needs that Sugar Deployment might face,
  including extreme ones like off-line environments and restricting
  hardware.
[Sugar-devel] [SWEETS] Testing collaboration related fixes 05/07/2012
Hi all!
Following the plan for Harmonic Distribution v0.2 (which will be a basis
for Sugar Distribution to use in peruvian pilot), in Sugar Shell code
were made fixes that are intended to make Telepathy (everything related to
Neighbourhood view and Sugar Activities sharing/joining) more stable
(that was broken since global redesign started after 0.88 release).
Fixes are accessible from SweetsDistribution:Factory repository. Follow
regular Sweets Distribution installation instructions[1] to install
fixed Sugar Shell on all supported platforms[2].
Some visible changes in F1 view:
* the number of buddies should be increased from ~20 to 70-90
  some Sugar versions (maybe 0.90-0.92) don't publish information about
  nickname/colors on regular basis; this information are being stored on
  disk for now
* for some buddies, server still don't have information about colors
  (replaced by gray) and nick names (jabber ids)
If you have a time and want to help Puno deployment pilot, please,
consider possibility to install sweets-desktop from Factory repository
and do some testing of collaboration functionality.

Some tips:

* while interacting with another buddies, make sure that all
  participants use Sweets Distribution (some F1 buddies might misbehave)
* the good criteria of stability level of new Sugar is comparing with
  how collaboration happen in 0.88 Sugar.

Pungi
Advanced
used to build non-live CD/DVD isos
Pungi needs to run on the arch it is composing, as root, and with an install of what it is composing, eg if you are composing Fedora 8, you need to be running Fedora 8.
This is so that the correct userland tools are used to create the images and such used by anaconda.
The eventual usage of pungi will most likely be in mock chroots to facilitate this.
It needs to run on the arch it is composing due to how anaconda-runtime determines what files to put in the boot images at this time.
Currently the releases of pungi are designed to run on an updated Rawhide system. Development of pungi always tracks Rawhide.

mock package

There is a git user named "pootle" that acts as the proxy by which all
PO file translations are committed from the Pootle server.  Please
make pootle a committer on the repo and I will make the connections
between git and the Pootle server.
Some "best practices" about working with git and Pootle are described here.

The three step XSCE demo!
Hi, Had some time on my hand this week to try out XSCE in a virtual environment. It actually worked out pretty well, and now there's a working appliance. Here's the three step XSCE demo!
Step #1 - Download and install Virtualbox
    Head to
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
to download the Virtualbox package for your OS.
    Install instructions may vary for different platforms but should be pretty straightforward.
Step #2 - Download and install the XSCE appliance
    Download the XSCE Virtualbox appliance from here
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3eW2YPe6koIVXRVbDhSR0xXQ1U
(approx 1.6 GB)
    [optional] Verify the md5sum to see if the image is not corrupt - 56a4f141b564b0d2bd65c543a5e585c6
    Open Virtualbox. Go to File -> Import Appliance.
    A dialog will appear asking you to "Open Appliance"
    Select the file you just downloaded "b_1364170741.ova"
    Click "Next" and then click "Import"
    A new virtual machine will get created
Step #3 - Play!
    Start the virtual machine just created. It will open a window, and an OS will appear to boot.
    Wait till it boots. Once it has booted, a login prompt will appear in a text console. Your XSCE is now up and ready!
    To test/demo, on the host OS (i.e., the one where you are running the virtualbox software in) open a browser
        XSCE homepage:
http://localhost:3380/
From the homepage you should be able to navigate to Internet In A Box. This image contains a test dataset.
            The link to the moodle homepage will NOT work. To access moodle, go to
http://localhost:3380/moodle/login/index.php
. I am not able to login, and there seems some issue with the homepage loading.
        Administrative GUI:
http://localhost:9990
(username=root, password=admin)
        Server monitoring tool - Munin:
http://localhost:3380/munin
(username=admin, password=munindxs)
        To check the authserver, go to
http://localhost:5000/
(It will probably say "No Sugar platform detected, please register your laptop")
Notes:
    This is only meant to be a quick demo to see what an XSCE is on your laptop/PC.
    I didn't setup root login (or atleast don't know the password to it). So you won't be able to login to the XSCE once it's running. Should not be a huge issue just for end-user demo purposes.
    This is just a weekend hack, I did based on a Vagrantfile supplied by Santi. At this moment, this is not officially supported or anything (but as far as I know in my testing, it works!)
    If this is a useful thing to maintain (based on feedback to this thread :-) ) I (or somebody else) can propose this as a feature for 0.5/6. So there are officially supported demo appliances.
    A wiki page is in the works. 
Please try it out and let me know what you think of it!
Thanks, Anish

I have this set up now in "appliance mode", considering people may want
to try it out without running a dhcp server and possibly breaking their
network(s).  Single NIC, bridged. (Apparently running this DHCP server should not cause issues with others as schoolserver's dhcp server is set to be 'not authoritative' but I will leave it this way for now)
If you wanted to change the mode, I believe you only have to go into the
machine settings in VirtualBox, add a NIC, boot up the VM and rerun

Reply [Server-devel] XSCE 5.0 (aka 0.5, upgraded from 0.4) VirtualBox Files
Unfortunately this XSCE VM project is on hold for me for a week or so as I'll be in Haiti.
I can add anyone who wants to work on it to the "sharing" list so the files could sync between our Google Drives.
I would only ask that if changing the original files whatever is done is documented and emailed to me (and/or this list).
IIAB - I noticed that EN wikipedia was missing too, I think the EN module is easily added.  Probably you can copy it from a full version of IIAB into the relevant directory and it will show up in the list.
Midori is pointing to schoolserver/syans as the last location - 
I previously had some proprietary content served from that location but removed it for sharing purposes and forgot to clear the history, I guess.
 I installed Firefox for  in-browser PDF reading (also related to the proprietary content).
OVA is probably a better distribution method unless people prefer to sync the files in our Google Drives.
I don't claim any ownership of these files, so feel free to create and share an OVA, link to them, etc.  OVA is almost certainly a better option for 'to the world' releases of the XSCE test VM on blogs, etc.
Thanks Curt Thompson"

 When the IIAB registers via DHCP it advertises its name as "know", and if the DHCP server and the DNSserver talk to each other the DNS server will resolve the name.
dnsmasq does this, so I suspect that might be what School Server runs?)
The only down side to this is that if you reboot the school server,you may find you need to then reboot the IIAB device so it gets afresh DHCP lease because the school server may forget it exists. 
...
Tony Anderson:
The school server is gateway and dns for the XOs and can certainly resolve
http://know
to a fixed address, which is the more orthodox way to do this.
Incidentally, I believe the problem with the wiki is that the url is
http://schoolserver/wiki4schools/
not
http://schoolserver/wiki
.
Normally, the XOs access everything from the Browse home page so that keyboard entry of urls is not needed. However, because of the xo-custom script problems this was not set up.

Response from alex kleider
Tom, thanks for your response.  Based on what I see
"""wlan0   ......
           Mode: managed  Access Point: Not associated
"""
and the fact that it has no IP address,
I'm guessing that it's not doing much of anything in its current state
but the fact that "Access Point" is even mentioned, suggests that
perhaps we can be guardedly optimistic that it might be do-able.
Please let me know if you make any progress in this regard.
It would probably require low level configuration commands similar to
"""
# We always bootup in AP mode. Delete any stale files
#rm -f /etc/wlanclient.mode
curdir=/root/k2.6.39.4
insmod $curdir/mlan.ko
i nsmod $curdir/sd8787.ko drv_mode=2

Test3 Expand 16GB to 32GB
Used

in a fedora laptop SD slot witj SD adapter to expand the 3rd partition on the class 10 microSD to the full 32 GB size.
Booted correctly after the expansion in the CuBox-i4P
Note must hit {TAB} and {space} repeatedly to get boot to work?
Hot Plug
with the 3.10 kernel, you can use the eSATA port even if there is no drive enabled when the system boots; add this to the kernel arguments:
ahci_imx.hotplug=1
Esatap is a single cable supplying power and data, so you want esata+ USB to esatap male

Debian on Chromebook
Entering Developer Mode
http://goo.gl/TSZxs
"On this device, both the recovery button and the dev-switch have been virtualized.
Our partners don't really like physical switches - they cost money, take up space on the motherboard, and require holes in the case.
To invoke Recovery mode, you hold down the ESC and Refresh keys and poke the Power button.
To enter Dev-mode you first invoke Recovery, and at the Recovery screen press Ctrl-D (there's no prompt - you have to know to do it).
It will ask you to confirm, then reboot into dev-mode.
Dev-mode works the same as always: It will show the scary boot screen and you need to press Ctrl-D or wait 30 seconds to continue booting.
You'll still have to run "crossystem dev_boot_usb=1" and reboot once to boot from USB drives with Ctrl-U. 
To leave Dev-mode and go back to normal mode, just follow the instructions at the scary boot screen. It will prompt you to confirm.
If you want to leave Dev-mode programmatically, you can run "crossystem disable_dev_request=1; reboot" from a root shell  .
Th ere's no way to enter Dev-mode programmatically, and just seeing the Recovery screen isn't enough -  
you have to use the three-finger salute which hard-resets the machine first.
 That's to prevent a remote attacker from tricking your machine into dev-mode without your knowledge.
An unrelated note: Holding just Refresh and poking the Power button hard-resets the machine without entering Recovery.
 That's occasionally useful, but use it with care - it doesn't sync the disk or shut down politely,
 so there's a nonzero chance of trashing the contents of your stateful partition."
