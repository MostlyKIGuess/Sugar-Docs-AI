or
IRC

Supporters
We're currently in the "get ideas" phase; please see
Development Team/Project Ideas
for a list of potential projects, and add your own. (There are some
more project ideas
from a brainstorming session at Sugar Camp that should be ported over; let
Mchua
know if you'd like to help with this.)
We would welcome help coordinating the overall effort as well; please contact
Mchua
if you'd like to get involved with this.
Community-building ideas
The mentoring org application includes the following questions:
What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?
What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?
This is a place for brainstorming these issues.
[11:59] <mchua> homunq: we also need a general plan for how we're going to use this as a good community building tool for new developers, though that's a little vague
[11:59] <mchua> homunq: stuff like "would a weekly check-in email be a good idea?" "do we require mentor meetings on IRC?" "are students mandated to blog about their work?"
