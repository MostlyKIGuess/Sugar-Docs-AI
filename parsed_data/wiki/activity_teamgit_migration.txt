How to migrate activity source control from laptop.org to sugarlabs.org.
Import a module from dev.laptop.org
Create
an account on
http://git.sugarlabs.org
Log in
and
create a new project
from the projects page (please use
only lower case
, e.g. sugar, turtleart, sugar-toolkit).
Clone
your git module from dev.laptop.org, e.g.
git clone
git://dev.laptop.org/projects/pippy-activity
See
all the remote branches with:
git remote show origin
Check out
the remote branches you want to migrate, e.g.
git checkout -b sucrose-0.82 origin/sucrose-0.82
Push
it to git.sugarlabs.org with something like:
git push gitorious@git.sugarlabs.org:pippy-activity/mainline.git
Add
the pootle user as a committer (from the "add committer" link on the mainline page) and send mail to
Sayamindu
, to point pootle to new remote.
Notify
sugar-devel
about the move.
Make sure
that sugar-jhbuild points to the new repository (ask someone to do it for you if you have no access)
