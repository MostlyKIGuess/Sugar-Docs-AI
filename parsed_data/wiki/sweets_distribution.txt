distributions
.
The major reasons to support all these repositories are:
Let people to try new functionality which is not available from the regular sources;
Support GNU/Linux distributions that lack of Sugar Learning Platform from official repositories;
Bring recent Sugar Learning Platform versions to systems initially released with older Sugar.
Repositories
Sweets Distribution is formed as a
list of repositories
that can be added to the system. Only one repository can be registered in the system at the same time. Repositories are identified by names and might be in stable or development stage. Different repositories might be available on different platforms from the
supported platforms list
.
Installation
The installation occurs in two phases:
add
one of Sweets Distribution repositories to local system;
install
packages from added Sweets Distribution repository.
Add repository

manual instructions
to add Sweets Distribution
repositories
to the system.

sudo sh sweets-distribution.sh

, repository in the system

Install packages
When the
sweets-distribution select
command finishes, the local system will be aware of the Sweets Distribution repository and it will be possible to install packages.
In the regular way for your operating system (such as with
apt-get install
or
yum install
), from a local system terminal, console, or via SSH, install one of the following packages:
sweets-desktop

Sometimes, it may be required to downgrade packages while switching to another repository. The easy way to do so is with the
sync
command:
sudo sweets-distribution sync
Most of the Sweets Distribution packages will be placed in the
/opt/sweets
directory; thus, it will be possible to use Sugar from the Sweets Distribution and from official packages at the same time.
Usage
Below are instructions on how to use the Sweets Distribution after
installing
packages.
Sweets Desktop session
If
sweets-desktop
package was installed, it will be possible to log in to a Sweets Desktop session. Choose the
Sweets Desktop
session type in a login manager.
Run Sugar in a window
To run Sugar in a window without logging out from the current desktop environment, select the
Education/Sugar
application menu item or enter the following command in a terminal:
sweets-sugar-emulator
Run Sugar full screen
Run this command in a terminal or edit the properties of the menu item for
Sugar
sweets-sugar-emulator -f, --fullscreen
Sugar Activities
For stable 0.94 and 0.88 repositories, the following points are assumed:
Fructose activities need to be used only from Sweets Distribution packages, at least for ones that have external dependencies, i.e., they should not be upgraded from the
Activity Library
;
The rest of activities need to be handled manually, e.g., manual installing missed dependencies.
All other repositories should bring
Sugar Network
integration, a different design solution for handling Sugar Activities.
Sugar Network
is assumed to improve the process of launching Sugar Activities to make it more reliable and smooth. By default, Sugar Network integration might be switched off,
enable
it after installation.
