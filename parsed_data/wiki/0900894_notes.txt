Sucrose 0.89.4 Release Notes
Announcement
This is our development release number 4 in the
0.90 development cycle
!
We now reached UI Freeze! We are glad to announce that three more Features have been pushed.
This Feature
removes the need for the Presence Service, meaning that activities and the Shell need to interact directly with non-Sugar-specific services such as Telepathy.
The Spiral Home View
is an enhancement to the Home View to enable the display of more icons. The idea is that after the circle becomes too large, rather than shrinking the icons, it morphs into a spiral. Only after the spiral no longer fits on the screen do the icons shrink.
New filtering options
have been added to the Journal. You can sort now by size, creation date and modification date.
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
There are no known compatibility issues, as of today.
Update to this version
Please use the instructions for your distribution (SoaS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian etc) of choice to upgrade to this release. Note that it may take a while until the release is packaged for each distribution. Please stay tuned for distribution specific announcements and watch out for updates at

What is new for packagers
New API has been added to telepathy-gabble and telepathy-salut to support the work on the collaboration framework, which results in needing 0.9.16 for tp-gabble and 0.3.13 for tp-salut.
One of the goals of the collaboration refactoring was dropping functionality in sugar that has been implemented in
telepathy-mission-control
, so Sugar now depends on tp-mission-control 5.4.3.
