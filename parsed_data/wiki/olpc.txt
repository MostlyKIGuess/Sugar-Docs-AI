Using Sugar on an XO
This section tries to capture a number of OLPC-specific hints to using Sugar.
Keyboard shortcuts
The XO laptop has dedicated keys that can be used in navigating the Sugar interface. Please see
the keyboard shortcuts page
in the
OLPC wiki
.
USB Ethernet adapters
See the
USB Ethernet Adapters
page for a list of options.
Click
To “click”, press once on the left-hand touchpad button—the button with the × symbol at the front of the touchpad.
Getting connected
Please refer to the
Wi-Fi Connectivity page

Wireless Loss
XO machines may experience problems with Access Points not showing in network neighbourhood, or taking a long time to be shown, especially as the number of XO laptops in a room increases. This is now fixed: On XO-4 (8787), the problem does not occur, on OLPC OS 11.3.1 and earlier the problem should not occur, and the solution is to upgrade to 13.2.1. Read more at
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/12757
On XO-1.5 machines, an aggressive suspend and resume may also cause wifi to stop working. The solution is to go to Control Panel, Power, and uncheck powersaving.
Mesh Networking Deprecated
XO-1.5's do not have Mesh networking support, so they use 802.11 Ad-hoc
networks.  XO-1's default to Mesh networks at the moment for compatibility,
because that is what they historically have done.
Once an XO-1.5 starts an Ad-hoc network, the XO-1's will spot that network
within a minute or two, and use the same Mayan numeral as the XO-1.5 to
indicate its presence.  If all the XOs leave an Ad-hoc network it
disappears; but Network Manager/Sugar cache its presence for a while in case
a scan accidentally missed a network.
When an XO-1 sees an Ad-hoc networks they are all filled in as "occupied",
because an XO-1 does not show the unfilled variants to allow an XO-1 to
start them.
This behavior has been around since OLPC build 10.1.3 (860) & Sugar 0.90,
and is described at
Features/Ad_hoc_Networking
I believe XO-1's can be adjusted to default to Ad-hoc as well if desired
