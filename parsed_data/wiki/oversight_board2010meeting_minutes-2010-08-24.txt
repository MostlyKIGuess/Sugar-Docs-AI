Election
Maintainers
We had general discussion of the state of maintainers within the Sugar community. It was pointed out that we have maintainers being supported by OLPC, Collabora, and AC. We celebrated this and also expressed the goal of developing more maintainers from within the deployments.
Election
We will be holding an Oversight Board election in October. Three positions have terms expiring: cjb, seandaly, and canoeberry. In the run up to the election, we need to:
update our membership list (lfaraone has agreed to do this);
solicit candidates;
prepare the ballot; and
run the election.
The following message was send to the lists:
