from Anish Aug-20:
this is where i stand, if collab is too much work, we look at reverting to old version or staying with old sugar altogether...
there are quite a lot of things au asked for, if we were to put entire resources into collab, those features will not get justice
we also have to look though at the fact that au will use dx3 for a few years, so 0.88/0.94 might not be a 'big' point for them. in two-three yrs time, sugar might well be on a very diff version no.
Prolong Dextrose-2 life
Another option is prolonging Dextrose-2 support/development, for some time, e.g. a year, while coding new collab code and release new Dextrose based on sugar-0.94+ with
well-auto-tested-for-regressions
collaboration code.
