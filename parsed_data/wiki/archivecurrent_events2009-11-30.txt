Sugar Digest
1. When Tony Forster
modified the Physics activity
within 24 hours of its initial posting on activities.sugarlabs.org, it was a sign that educators, not just developers, were beginning to take a lead in determining the shape of Sugar. But even more important than contributing patches is contributing to the growing body of knowledge about how to use Sugar for learning. Rosamel Norma Ramirez Mendez has been an outspoken voice on the
Sur list
, telling stories from her classroom (Rosamel is a teacher in Uruguay) and challenging the community in regard to using technology for learning to its maximum potential. She has recently
blogged about some innovative uses of Turtle Art
, which naturally caught my attention, and wrote a
remarkable post on the Sur list about guided discovery
. It is really gratifying to hear these stories from the field.
2. We held an oversight board meeting on 20 November. We passed a motion to close the slobs@ list to just SLOBs, move current slobs@ traffic to iaep@ with a [SLOBS] subject line tag where at all possible. We also passed a motion to give a two-week deadline to the Sugar-on-a-Stick decision panel. We spend the remainder of the meeting discussing our trademark policy. We are examining the policies of other projects to get ideas about how we might amend our own policy going forward. We'll continue the discussion on iaep@ and at the next scheduled meeting, Friday, 04 December, 2009 â€“ 15:00 UTC (10:00 EST).
Minutes
and a
log
from the 20 November meeting are available in the wiki.
