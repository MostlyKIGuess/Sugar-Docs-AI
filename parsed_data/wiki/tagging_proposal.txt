Use cases
Use case 1: finding people with similar interests
Pepe enjoyed during the weekend his first rock climbing experience and would
like to find other people in his school who also like it.
Use case 2: limiting the mesh view to a subset defined locally
Maria is a teacher and would like that during her classes, only her students in
that class appear in the mesh view.
Proposed user experience
Use case 1: finding people with similar interests
Pepe tags itself as climbing, and when someone searches in the mesh view for
"climbing", Pepe will appear in the results.
Use case 2: limiting the mesh view to a subset defined locally
Maria tags each of the students in that class with the tag "my_class", so that
when searches in the mesh view for that text, only her students appear. In the
case that someone else has tagged himself with that same tag, it will appear as
well in the results, but will be marked differently as the local matches.
