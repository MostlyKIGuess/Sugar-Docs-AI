Merge page
Please work to update
Supported systems
turning it into an index to the
Community/Distributions
subpages, which should each be moved to a top level page. --

Would this work?

I'd rather stick with the titled concept, the shorter subset of supported systems/distributions, as opposed to a long list of unsupported ones. (A link to the DistroWatch list could be included for those curious about the scope of distributions and as part of a definition of what a distribution is.) --

Sure, it would be edited down to the correct number of distros (as an index, easily enlargeable), but is this what you mean by "top level page"? --

Yes, for example,
Community/Distributions/Ubuntu
would be moved (using the wiki move page link) to
Ubuntu
, replacing the redirect that is there now. --

How do you feel about a "clean page start", a pure index of
Supported distributions
? --

That sounds reasonable.
Supported distributions
can be an annotated index, useful for transclusion to other pages such as
Downloads#Do you use GNU/Linux?
and
Sugar Creation Kit#Community Distributions A Complete Listing
;
Ways to run Sugar
could hold the introductory sections;
Updating Sugar
could hold general guidance on that process.  They can stand independently, or be composed by transclusion into
Supported systems
or
Systems that run Sugar
. All these pages should be targeted primarily for non-developers, but with guidance that serves as a primer for curious and developing minds. --

The downside of distributions pages being top level pages is that they (and their child pages) cannot then be collected together automatically.  I have added the Community/Distributions SubPage index to
Supported systems
, to demonstrate a different approach. If the distro-specific material currently in
Supported systems
could all be updated into correct distro page, would the resulting
Supported systems
page be useful? --

Yes, temporarily; but please design
Supported distributions
to be transcluded in place of the sections mentioned above. Each supported distribution page can also be categorized as such and then collected in a Category page.  The Special:PrefixIndex page is useful as an interim list, but suffers because it cannot be formatted, annotated, logo-ized, or reordered, such as by completeness and currency of Sugar support, like the proposed replacement.  --

Why not just link to the Community Distributions wiki pages links shown on the SCK page,
Linux Distributions where sugar is available
? Why reinvent the wheel? I feel that this listing on SCK (which is almost all the result of my investigation) is important to be left alone on the SCK page. --

Please understand that the wiki allows
mediawikiwiki:Transclusion
of whole pages (with some adjustments, which are convenient only for reusing one part of a page).  Also note the publishing and maintenance goals to reduce redundancy described in
the call to reorganize the SCK page
. If
Linux Distributions where sugar is available
is the best listing, it can be integrated to serve the full wiki, as in this demonstration,
Supported distributions
