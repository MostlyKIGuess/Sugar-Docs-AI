Sugar on a Stick (Blueberry)
enables children to reclaim computers.
Sugar on a Stick
aims to make it easy for children, parents, or local deployers to provide each student with a small device (USB stick or thumbdrive) that can start any computer with the student's personalized Sugar environment. We would like to see Sugar's presence, journal, and clarity principles usable on any machine â€” at school, at home, and anywhere there is a suitable computing device.
Sugar on a Stick (Blueberry)
is based on Fedora 12.
