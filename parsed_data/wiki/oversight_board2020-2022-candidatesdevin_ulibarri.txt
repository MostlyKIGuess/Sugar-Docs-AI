--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devin Ulibarri has been involved with Sugar Labs for approx. 6 years, and on SLOBS the past 2 years. His main contribution has been to help create what is now known as Music Blocks.
During these two years, SLOBs decided unanimously to leave SFC.
Leaving SFC has been hard work. Devin has been involved with transitioning Sugar Labs to self-governance. There is more work to be done. His hope is that Sugar Labs becomes a place where teachers and learners thrive, and that the Sugar Labs philosophy becomes much more common in education circles around the globe.
