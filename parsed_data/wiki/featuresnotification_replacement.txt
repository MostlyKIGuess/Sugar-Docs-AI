Sam P.
Email: samDELETEME@sugarlabs.org  (You need to get rid of the DELETEME.)
Current status
Targeted release: 0.104
Last updated: 10/Aug/2014
Percentage of completion: 50% - needs discussion
Benefit to Sugar
Progress notifications
Compatibility with the rest of the Linux desktop world
Scope
It is a small change that does not break compatibility.
It pretty much needs
Features/Notification_Urgency
so you can replace notifications without a flashy popup thing.
UI Design
None - the notifications are just changed - no animation - no nothing
How To Test
Run and change this in Pippy:
import dbus
BUS_NAME = 'org.freedesktop.Notifications'
OBJ_PATH = '/org/freedesktop/Notifications'
IFACE_NAME = 'org.freedesktop.Notifications'
bus = dbus.SessionBus()
notify_obj = bus.get_object(BUS_NAME,OBJ_PATH)
notifications = dbus.Interface(notify_obj,IFACE_NAME)

id = notifications.Notify("Software Update", 0, "", "New activities are available!", "Please check your activities list", [], {'x-sugar-icon-name': 'module-updater', 'urgency': 1}, -1)

import time
time.sleep(10)

notifications.Notify("Software Update", id, "", "MORE New activities are available!", "Please check your activities list AGAIN", [], {'x-sugar-icon-name': 'module-updater', 'urgency': 0}, -1)
Dependencies
None!
