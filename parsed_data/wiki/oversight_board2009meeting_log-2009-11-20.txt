<tomeu>
hi all!
<walterbender>
do we have a quorum?
<mchua>
though from what I've read it sounds like Bolzano went quite well :) wish I coul dhave been there!
<mchua>
looks like we do.
<walterbender>
mchua: it was a very fun, productive week
<walterbender>
ok

<mchua>
for last week's logs on the subject
<walterbender>
we concluded last week's meeting with a motion regarding mailing lists, but we wanted to keep the discussion opne before the vote because three of you were absent
<walterbender>
shall we restate the motion?
<walterbender>:
<cjb> MOTION: close the slobs@ list to just SLOBs, move current slobs@ traffic to iaep@ with a [SLOBS] subject line tag where at all possible
<walterbender>
any further discussion?
<mchua>
appreciated :) though I would also have been totally fine with the vote going forward (it's why we come up with the decision procedures, imo - because we trust SLOBs to do things in the absence of a few of us)
<mchua>
none from me
<walterbender>
mchua: we could have voted, but we wanted the input... not a pressing issue
mchua	nods
<walterbender>
Adam, any thoughts? comments?
<mchua>
CanoeBerry: ^^
<walterbender>
OK. the motion had been seconded, so let's bring it to vote.
walterbender	says aye
<tomeu>
+1 from me
<mchua>
aye
<SeanDaly>
aye
<mchua>
CanoeBerry, cjb, bernie: ^^?
<walterbender>
(is bernie actually awake?)
<cjb>
aye
<mchua>
(we do have a majority, enough to pass the motion)
<walterbender>
well, the motion passes and I'll make the changes this week (along with a notification to the current list members)
<walterbender>
(If I can remember the admin password for SLOBS :) )
<CanoeBerry>
Ciao, just arrive late..
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: we just voted on MOTION: close the slobs@ list to just SLOBs, move current slobs@ traffic to iaep@ with a [SLOBS] subject line tag where at all possible
<walterbender>
While Adam is reading the backlog, perhaps we can move through the rest of the agenda.
<CanoeBerry>
Still there all?
-->|	aa (n=aa@r190-135-189-132.dialup.adsl.anteldata.net.uy) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walterbender>
without Bernie, I think we cannot discuss the Teams list idea
<walterbender>
and I have heard nothing from the DP.
<walterbender>
sdziallas: is a report ready yet?
<sdziallas>
walterbender: I'm not sure what the current state of it is. There's been some editing on the wiki going on. Side-noting that I didn't expected myself to be leading that thing (if only bias-wise)
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: you are on DP too. Do you know the status?
<sdziallas>
history page basically says nothing's been changed since October 9.
<tomeu>
mtd may know more?
<walterbender>
I had proposed (but we never ratified) a deadline for their report.
<walterbender>
I suggest we give them one, as this seems to be stalled
<mchua>
+1. Do we need anything other than a firm final recommendation from the DP (along with the vote from everyone on the DP on that report?)
<sdziallas>
tomeu: I haven't been able to catch mtd lately. :/
<cjb>
walterbender: well, we came up with lots of policy about timing out DPs at a previous meeting, but I think we were aiming it mainly at future DPs rather than this one
<walterbender>
mchua: I don't think we need more than their report
<cjb>
yeah, we should offer them a timeout
<CanoeBerry>
great, what deadline?
<walterbender>
cjb: I'd perhaps use a strong word than offer :)
<cjb>
of course, then we get into the question of "what happens when you create a DP and it times out before giving you an answer; how do decisions get made?"
<cjb>
walterbender: so the reason I say offer, is that there are two possible outcomes
<cjb>
one is that they finish everything within a week (say)
<cjb>
if they can't do that, that's okay, and we should just cancel the DP
<walterbender>
cjb: I think it if times out, Slobs will have to table it or reconvene a new panel
<cjb>
so the offer is between the two outcomes
<cjb>
ah. that would suck.
<walterbender>
cjb: agreed. It would suck.
cjb	will spare you all from grumping about Decision Panels this week.
sdziallas	notes that there are still people not having put their opinion down.
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: no i don't my impression was that SJ was working toward the consensus positions
<mchua>
It would suck, but it would also unblock us.
|<--	aa has left freenode (Remote closed the connection)
<walterbender>
cjb: but the work they did is recorded, so we can use it as input.
<cjb>
mchua: no.
<cjb>
the community is still as blocked.
<cjb>
we get to pretend that it's unblocked, but it's just pretend.
<CanoeBerry>
a deadline would greatly help -- I happened to run into Caryl (on DP) in Dallas here and she'd love to bring this to an end.
<SeanDaly>
I am very concerned about sugaronastick.com situation, threatens Blueberry launch
<walterbender>
Let's try a deadline.
<tomeu>
cjb: well, the bigger we get, the harder it will be to reach consensus. I don't think we should say that our community is blocked when it doesn't reach consensus on something
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: that is a different topic
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: yes I'm changing subject, beg pardon
<cjb>
tomeu: mm. I guess I don't always think it's wrong to make a decision in the face of lack of consensus.
<tomeu>
cjb: sure, slobs is there for that
<cjb>
if I'm in a meeting, and half the room wants to do one thing and half the other, and talking isn't helping, I'm likely to say "okay, let's just flip a coin so we can move on"
<cjb>
tomeu: ...
<cjb>
tomeu: but we're obviously not.
<walterbender>
motion: give a two-week deadline to the DP
<tomeu>
cjb: we were hoping that this DP will help us reach the best decision
<tomeu>
and it may help us even if they aren't presenting a report
<walterbender>
(two weeks because of the Thanksgiving Holiday)
<cjb>
help us to do what?
<tomeu>
because of what walterbender said: they have produced some kind of results
<cjb>
form a new panel afterwards?
<tomeu>
cjb: take a decision
<tomeu>
cjb: or not
<cjb>
walter just said we can't do that,
<cjb>
AIUI
<tomeu>
(I would say no in this case)
<walterbender>
cjb: I am not sure we need a new panel
<cjb>
10:12 <walterbender> cjb: I think it if times out, Slobs will have to table it
<cjb>
or reconvene a new panel
<cjb>
(note the lack of "or use their input to make a decision")
<tomeu>
what means to table it?
<walterbender>
I think we have learned a lot and I think there are some other ways to approach the issues
<cjb>
tomeu: the drop the subject without deciding anything
<cjb>
walterbender: yes, hopefully they'll come through with the deadline
<walterbender>
cjb: SLOBs can decide things based on the input, whether the DP reached consensus or not
<tomeu>
oh, in my view of DPs as helper instruments, I don't think slobs are bound to wait for them to decide something
<walterbender>
but we are jumping the gun.
<walterbender>
let's discuss my motion please
<cjb>
ok. let's wait two weeks, then; seconded.
<walterbender>
any further discussion about the deadline motion?
<tomeu>
+1 if nobody needs it more irgently
<mchua>
With the consequences of hitting the timeout as mentioned above?
<walterbender>
mchua: yes. as those are general consequences of DPs
<cjb>
mchua: which ones?
<CanoeBerry>
+1 on 2 week deadline
<SeanDaly>
aye to 2-week deadline
<cjb>
consequences: reconvene, or table the decision, or have SLOBs make a decision?
<walterbender>
cjb: and SLOBs will decide which of those options to take.
<cjb>
understood
<walterbender>
shall we vote?
mchua	nods
walterbender	aye
<cjb>
aye
<mchua>
aye
<SeanDaly>
aye
<CanoeBerry>
yea
<tomeu>
aye

#action walter to inform the DP
<walterbender>
#action (forgot to say earlier) walter to update sobs list and inform communioty
<walterbender>
#topic trademark
<walterbender>
did everyone (anyone) see the questions I posted in the wiki?
<cjb>
I don't think so
<walterbender>
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Minutes#Agenda_items
<cjb>
thanks
<CanoeBerry>
Aside: plz buzz yr NYC Sugar folk show up Saturday afternoon in Manhattan for our Community Summit..
<CanoeBerry>
http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/usa/olpc_nyc_community_summit.html
<walterbender>
I thin that if we sort these questions out, we'll have made a lot of progress re the DP questions and the soas.com questions
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: I loved the graphic...
<SeanDaly>
agreed
<CanoeBerry>
I've asked everyone to call it "OLPC-Sugar Community Summit" but some anonymous losers keep dropping "Sugar"
<CanoeBerry>
:)
<walterbender>
Personally, I think the Fedora guidelines are very good.
<tomeu>
CanoeBerry: we are used to it :p
<walterbender>
It is not restrictive except in the use of the name to ensure there is no implicit endorsement
<walterbender>
It is about being free but also being clear
<cjb>
walterbender: the Fedora Remix label (which OLPC uses) is interesting
<cjb>
you don't have to pass any of their technical standards, AIUI
<walterbender>
cjb: yes
<tomeu>
yeah, would be great if we can have such a escape valve
<walterbender>
cjb: As long as there is no suggestion of endorsement from SL, I am comfortable
<cjb>
ok
<cjb>
so perhaps we have a proto-motion to create Sugar Remixes
<walterbender>
if someone wants such an endorsement or affiliation, then there would be higher standards
<walterbender>
e.g., Free
<SeanDaly>
cjb: still a problem if Sugar is in the name
<cjb>
SeanDaly: not for Fedora, so you need to tell me why.
<tomeu>
anybody knows what ubuntu does about this?
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: see
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines#Business_web_sites
<SeanDaly>
cjb: Fedora is a weak brand. So is Sugar, but the plan is to grow it
<cjb>
SeanDaly: I don't think I'm going to like a policy that says that what our community really needs is more legal protection than Fedora
<cjb>
Fedora's been going for many years. We should walk before we run.
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: I will look at that (not easy now greeting visitors to booth)
<SeanDaly>
cjb: not a question of legal protection, a question of protecting a trademark so it can grow
<cjb>
trademarks aren't legal protection? :)
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: I don't expect we decide anything today, but I want to get the discussion going.
<SeanDaly>
The Firefox fork controversy more appropriate analogy
<cjb>
tomeu: I found
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Specs/DerivativeSpec
<cjb>
tomeu: but I think it's not very useful
-->|	erikos (n=erikos@g225094178.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walterbender>
hi erikos
<tomeu>
looks like ubuntu will learn from us :p
<walterbender>
erikos: feeling better?
SeanDaly	waves to erikos
<erikos>
hi walterbender - yes thanks ;p
erikos	waves back to SeanDaly
<walterbender>
in any case, if we sort this out, many of the other decisions will be much easier to make
<SeanDaly>
important to find workable policy and not have to improvise
<walterbender>
on a related note, I was speaking with sdziallas about Carlo's recommendation re SoaS remixes
<cjb>
yeah, we should probably adopt the policy of another project
sdziallas	looks up
<tomeu>
the questions that walter put in the wiki look like quite hard to me
<cjb>
that's true, we haven't answered those properly yet
<tomeu>
but I guess that fedora's policy would be an answer to all them?
<walterbender>
cjb: we can avoid answering some of them with the remix idea
<walterbender>
but we have to face up to all of them if someone wants an affiliation with SL
<cjb>
that's right
<walterbender>
But if we can decide on a process, we are in much better shape than our ad hoc methods to date.
<SeanDaly>
agreed
<walterbender>
It is only fair to potential partners that we have clear guidelines
<cjb>
I think we could start with "anyone who wants to ship a Sugar distribution is a Sugar Remix, and they can talk to us to get a technical review that would lead to them becoming part of the brand officially"
<cjb>
the questions that we ask and problems that we find aren't going to be very predictable ahead of time
<walterbender>
cjb: seems like a good place to start
<walterbender>
some questions are predictable, e.g., inclusion of non-Free packages
<SeanDaly>
cjb: I would hope if they wanted to help us grow the Sugar brand that they would contribute to marketing, within our guidelines
<cjb>
we'd want to decide, like Fedora, on which items of artwork and so on are brandable only to the Sugar brand
<walterbender>
and having some structure: where to put things, makes the process easier for everyone
<walterbender>
(Carlo's suggestion)
<cjb>
SeanDaly: yes, that sounds necessary
<mchua>
for reference:
<mchua>
#link
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix
<tomeu>
btw, I'm not sure if the question of the derivatives is more a quality one or a community one
<mchua>
#link
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix#Are_there_other_legal_requirements.3F
<mchua>
and the trademark guidelines in
<mchua>
#link
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix#Including_other_software
<walterbender>
tomeu: probably both--in terms of branding and support
<cjb>
mchua: thanks
<tomeu>
as in, if I will be the one maintaining the contribution, I will apply my quality standard to it. but if it's someone else who will maintain it, I do'nt care so much as there's some guarantees that that someone else will do a good enough job
<cjb>
we should probably go off and read everything linked from /Remix as homework
<walterbender>
mchua: can you add those links to the wiki?
<tomeu>
that's why accepting patches is a maintainer matter, and not a community one
<mchua>
do we want to get iaep discussion on the trademark questions on today's agenda?
<walterbender>
cjb: agreed.
<mchua>
walterbender: will do that now
<walterbender>
mchua: not sure I understand the question
<walterbender>
mchua: I was planning that we open this entire discussion up to iaep
<walterbender>
tomeu: re Sugar core, you are correct, but we also have the activities... a free-for-all...
<tomeu>
walterbender: hmm, how is different for activities?
<mchua>
walterbender: sorry, should rephrase - "at what point in our discusion today do we need to say 'ok, we need to take this to iaep now'? i.e. how much further SLOBs meeting discussion is helpful?"
<walterbender>
tomeu: each activity has a maintainer (at least in theory)
<CanoeBerry>
Just to confirm we're ending in 10min?
mchua	thinks this is in fact quite helpful, but we've got 10m left
<mchua>
CanoeBerry: jinx :)
<tomeu>
ok, I guess this is better discussed in the ml
<tomeu>
any actions coming out from this?
<walterbender>
mchua: I think we have gotten a good start--enough to seed a community discussion
<mchua>
In addition to asking iaep, I'd like to see if folks both here and there can talk with other projects about how they do this
<walterbender>
#action: walter will seed a community discussion on the topic
<walterbender>
mchua: good idea. maybe we can each be responsible for one community
<walterbender>
and report back next time
<walterbender>
mchua: can I volunteer you for Fedora :)
<walterbender>
tomeu: you want to talk to GNOME?
<mchua>
walterbender: yes, and one other project we'd like to check in on, since Fedora's policies are pretty copiously documented :)
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: you want to look at Mozilla?
<tomeu>
walterbender: ok, will try to find someone
<walterbender>
anyone wanna talk to Debian?
<walterbender>
Ubuntu?
<walterbender>
Other projects that come to mind?
<tomeu>
opensolaris?
<walterbender>
cjb: wanna to talk to OLPC about how they do it?
<tomeu>
fortunately, foss projects use to have their guidelines in quite public places
<walterbender>
and openSUSE
<tomeu>
http://live.gnome.org/Trademark
<cjb>
walterbender: ok
<walterbender>
I will talk to the openSUSE folks
<walterbender>
maybe we can assign Debian to Bernie :)
<mchua>
We can also ask for volunteers on iaep for other projects - I'm sure folks iwll have more they'd like to hear from, or that they can talk to.
<walterbender>
+1
<walterbender>
Time is about up. Shall we skip next Friday and go for the following Friday?
<walterbender>
(Thanksgiving)
<tomeu>
gnome's is very drafty :/
<cjb>
makes sense.
<walterbender>
tomeu has already finished his homework? :)
<tomeu>
I won't be able to report much ;)
<tomeu>
guess projects backed by big companies will have more developed trademark guidelines
<tomeu>
but they may not apply so well to us, dunno
<walterbender>
OK. any last comments before we close the formal meeting?
<CanoeBerry>
Thanks All. Apologies our "Honduras Church" in NYC has poor bandwidth tomorrow afternoon.
<CanoeBerry>
But Mike Lee will provide partial workaround..
<walterbender>
See you all here on 4 Dec? and in #sugar daily :)
<mchua>
Nice forward progress this meeting :)
<mchua>
4 dec!
<CanoeBerry>
Bye!
<walterbender>
thanks everyone.
