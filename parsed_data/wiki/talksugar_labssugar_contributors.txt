What about:
through promoting the idea of Sugar or advocating the importance of its target goals?
Of course
through Review and critique?  Is it possible for someone who cares about the work of Sugar Labs but thinks it is all misguided and works hard to change its course to be a member?
Only if they contribute their critique.
Also needing clarification: Is membership for life?  If not, how does one renew or lose membership?  Is there a process for nomination, or self-nomination?  Of course the Committee can deal with this once it is set up.  The most important distinction in my mind is whether membership is primarily through self-association and affiliation, through clearly defined heuristics requiring no human intervention (though perhaps with the option of a human veto / membership removal), or through a human approval process.

All good questions. We will have a membership committee that will sort through these issues, presumably. My though would be membership would be for the period of involvement, as that is when it would be relevant. Other ideas? --

For comparison, Ubuntu membership is for a two year period, and can be renewed on demonstration of continued contribution. More details:
"Generally, at least two months of visible, significant activity will be required."
Document your work on your home page on the ... Wiki.

This could be a way to go, 2 months of continuous contribution for initial membership  and renewal/removal of membership though and evaluation of the work done by the volunteer in the year by the membership committee.--

Transferring credits
Is transferring of work / commitment / participation portable? i.e., from other OLPC forums, laptop.org or otherwise, to be considered for Sugar Labs membership?

Downstream work that flows upstream should of course transferable!! --
