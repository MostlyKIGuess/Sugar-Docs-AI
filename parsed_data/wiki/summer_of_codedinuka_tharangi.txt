User Manual for Music Blocks
Dinuka Tharangi
Music Blocks is a free and open-source, browser-based software, designed basically for students to learn music in fun and interactive way. To get started with “music blocks”, newbies need to have a fundamental understanding of the software, what are the things can be done and importantly how things can be done. To address this requirement, “music block” has a user guide. But the existing user guide lacks most of the important information about the software components, how each building blocks in the software can be related to music and especially some examples of how to create music with the software. The objective of this project is to create a user manual which would be a simple and comprehensive guide while providing samples and related explanations. Deliverables of the project will be as follows:
Improve the Music blocks user guide content to be easily approachable to newbies.
Implement a documentation website for Music Blocks user guide.
Prepare a downloadable version of the Music Blocks user manual in Portable Document Format(PDF).
Make the website expandable for online contributions to documentation from the website itself.
