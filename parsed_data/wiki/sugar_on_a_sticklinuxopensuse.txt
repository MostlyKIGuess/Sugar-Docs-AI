The openSUSE version is a clicfs "dual mode" image that is burned to a stick by the dd command.
If just dd is used, creates a CD image on a USB. (Useful for Netbooks with no CD Drive)
fdisk can create a persistent 2nd partition (see below)

several ways to build a Live USB
Example record:
be sure /dev/sd(x) points to your USB (can destroy your Hard Disk if wrong) use Partition Manager to see proper label...

# fdisk /dev/sd(x)

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 3824.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
  (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
