We use
IRC
for our meetings. If you don't have an IRC client (yet), you can use webchat - go to
http://webchat.freenode.net
and connect to #sugar-meeting, or click the screenshot below. (Replace "your_name" or the random ID provided with your name or some other nick you'd like to be known by.)
How we run meetings
With as much involvement as possible at all times.
The motivation is to have as many simultaneous actively participating people in the meeting as possible - ideally, at
all times
in the meeting,
everyone
in the meeting should be
doing something really cool
(and hopefully related to Sugar on a Stick) - not just waiting for their turn to speak. Think of it as a virtual version of the
law of two feet
.

Discuss Naming Format for Soas Remixes
Soas-v(2-3-4)-mmddyear-(name)-Remix *
(name)-v(2-3-4)-mmddyear
Other format? ie: XFCE + sugar remix (sugar-emulator or gdm switcher) Is this still Soas? (Installed to a USB stick) liveusb-creator, script, or zyx-liveinstaller.
*Used here
