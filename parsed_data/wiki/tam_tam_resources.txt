Tam Tam Resources
Hi Folks,

I spent most of yesterday hunting up Tam Tam Resources for the IT teacher at a rural K8 school here in Montana.
They just received 10 XO-1s from a stalled Contributors Program project at MSU.
She is very  excited about using them, especially Tam Tam, since they lost the funding for elementary music this year.
She is hoping the elementary teachers will be able to teach their own music, some of it using TamTam Mini and TamTam Jam.
The middle school science teacher will also be using them for experiments and the like in his 6-8 grade science (and math?) classes.
We will be starting a blog for their project and, hopefully they will share their discoveries, lessons, etc. freely on the blog.
I would like to share the list of resources with you.  You will find them at the lower part of this email."

 Thanks! Caryl

Excellent and up-to-date Tam Tam Resources from Peru... in
       Spanish, but you should still find them very helpful. For parts
       that are not clear, you can cut and paste them into Google
       Translate.

Mini TamTam Demo
Made over 4 years ago when all of the TamTams were one
       application... but still useful.  You will open TamTam Mini from
       the icon in the ring in Home View rather than as he describes in
       the video. The items in the video that appear in the sidebar on
       the right, now appear on the left on the XO. For the drums...
       the start button is the arrow to the left of the dice, it
       changes into a square which is the stop button. Volume, reverb,
       and the ability to add your own sounds seem to have been taken
       out for TamTam Mini.  They will be in some of the more advanced
       TamTams. So, the part after 4:23 is no longer useful for
       learning to use TamTam Mini, but the part before that is good.

A teacher workshop in Peru
I notice the leader has given the teachers song sheets with the
       notes spelled out with the keyboard letters.  An interesting
       project could be to have students figure out some familiar songs
       and make similar song sheets to share with each other.

From Uruguay
A demo/training  video from "Canal Ceibal" in Uruguay showing
       how children might learn to compose and do musical
       improvisations on the XO.  The teachers and students go to a
       studio in Montevideo for the filming of these videos.   The
       white smocks for the children and the lab coats for the teachers
       are for real! It is a tradition for them to wear them that has
       been going on for a very long time.  We saw it when we visited 
       schools in Uruguay in May. They always dress that way, not just
       for special occasions!

       This one is long but very good.  The teacher and children are
       all speaking Spanish (of course!) but the lesson is excellent.
       They are learning to create songs and improvise on their XOs.
       They are from a "Music School."

BTW, This lesson fits very well with the Montana State Curriculum
       Standards for 4th Grade Music

Simpler lessons could be done with younger children
supplemental text materials
The files are sort of big, but if you'd like some supplemental text
materials explaining some of the instruments in the TamTam samples,
the musical scales available and some of the technical concepts that
can be found in TamTam SynthLab, you might want to look at this
wikislice I created (in PDF and ODT formats).
 
370 pages and 69 MB for the PDF

450 pages and 52 MB for the ODT, but it has pictures amnd can be edited
