Do we agree on the mission?
http://sugarlabs.org/go/BugSquad/Mission
(got accepted)
What is needed in trac to start triaging?
add sucrose components
add milestones
base work flow on
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Trac_ticket_workflow
distribution field (where was the bug found)
Meetings: when/if
schedule weekly triage meetings (especially to get people started, but things should be setup so that triaging happens async, because it needs to be a continuous)
at #sugar-meeting
Sprints: when/if
after releases
at #sugar-meeting
Do we need a dedicated mailing list?
No, we mostly have announcements and use tags for cases like: "I was triaging bug #567 but didn't know what to do?"
sugar-devel - [bugsquad] and [bugsquad][announce]
wiki note: "you can always triage at any time, and if you'd like to schedule your own sugar triage sprint, please do and announce it $here! if you're new and want help getting started but can't make a sprint, ask $here_2."
irc questions at #sugar
Create a list of concrete tasks we expect the BugSquad to do regularly
solicit distributions for testing of new releases
maintain the BugSquad wiki pages (especially with policies like "we use #sugar for discussion, tag your sugar-devel posts this way")
add components, tags, milestones
triage tickets
provide feedback on how to improve bug advocacy on a ticket, when requested. ("How could I have written this bug report better / which developers should I ping on it"?)
Triage Policy:
Who is responsible for setting priorities and milestones?
the bug gets in
bug squad make the bug nice (a well-written bug report, a suggestion on the next step to push it to developers for fixing - who to talk to, etc.), assign to maintainer
maintainer assign a milestone
the dev does fix it
What needs to be happen to mark a ticket as fixed?
not fully discussed the policy
