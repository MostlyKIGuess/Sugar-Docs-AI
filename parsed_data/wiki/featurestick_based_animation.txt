Summary
Smoother Animations.
Animate each frame as Gtk+ needs a new frame drawn instead of at whatever frame rate we want.

Detailed Description
Gtk+ 3.8 introduces the idea of a 'tick'.  This can have a callback attached to it.  This is used to do animations in GtkPopover and the other Gtk+ widgets that have animations.  Therefore, sugar should not just do out animations at 20fps.  If the animation could go at 120fps because the computer is awesome, why not?  If the computer is bad and it can only render 5fps, why worry about any more?
This feature can be split up into many parts:
Toolkit implementation (100%):
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-toolkit-gtk3/pull/213
Frame and Home view (100%):
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/pull/505
Frame and homeview are a good spot for tick based animation as we are not cpu bound to open the frame or change views - the animation can take up 100% cpu and all will be fine
Pulsing icon (NO-GO):
https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/pull/513
Opening an activity is a cpu bound task, so this is probably the wrong space for animations that steal all of the cpu.  This patch TRIPLES activity start times on the XO4.
Benefit to Sugar
Smoother animation.
No legit, that is the only benefit.
Scope
Animation consumers need to add the "widget=x" when creating an animator so they can have the tick callback attached.
Consumers who don't are not effected.
UI Design
None

Animations are now smoother than ever on newer hardware.  Animations dynamically change FPS to leave no cpu cycle wasted.
