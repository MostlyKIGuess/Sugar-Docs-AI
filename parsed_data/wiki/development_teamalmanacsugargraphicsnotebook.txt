Class: Notebook(
gtk.Notebook
)
Sugar has its own notebook class that is built on top of gtk.Notebook. Use the sugar version so that you can access specialized methods as needed.
How do I create a new notebook and populate it with pages?
The simple example below creates three pages, each with different types of containers. You can make anything a page in your notebook as long as it is a valid gtk container.
from sugar.graphics.notebook import Notebook
...
        top_canvas = Notebook()
        
        #Create pages for the notebook
        first_page = gtk.VBox()
        second_page = gtk.VBox()
        third_page = gtk.Frame()

        #Add the pages to the notebook. 
        top_box.add_page('First Page', first_page)
        top_box.add_page('Second Page', second_page)
        top_box.add_page('Third_Page', third_page)

        #Set the canvas for this activity's UI to be the notebook object just created. 
        self.set_canvas(top_canvas)
How do I do other standard operations on a sugar Notebook?
Most other work with the sugarized notebook can be done by using the
gtk.Notebook
interface
