<meeting>
Meeting started at 10:01 UTC. The chair is walterbender.
<meeting>
Commands Available: #TOPIC, #IDEA, #ACTION, #AGREED, #LINK
<walterbender>
We have an agenda in the wiki...
<walterbender>
the first topic is Bernie's but he is not here yet...
<walterbender>
the second topic is the DP. has anyone heard back from the committee?
<cjb>
nope
<SeanDaly>
not I
<walterbender>
nor I :(
<walterbender>
I know they got my message regarding the deadline
<walterbender>
I am afraid this process has not worked.
<bernie>
This is Bernie, Adam, and Mel.
<bernie>
We're all here.
<walterbender>
ciao bernardo
<SeanDaly>
greetings bernieadammel
<walterbender>
do you need the backlog?
<bernie>
no, we have it.
<bernie>
(Mel is typing)
<walterbender>
since bernie is here, let's start with his topic.
<bernie>
which topic is that?
<walterbender>
#TOPIC teams@ lists
<bernie>
Ah, yes. I see.
<walterbender>
Bernie, can you summarize your proposal?
<bernie>
I worry that we'd end up using long cc lists too much if we do not have a standard way to share business/strategic communication with key people such as team leaders
<bernie>
I'd propose a teams@ list for this kind of communication.
<SeanDaly>
I like this idea
<SeanDaly>
often worry about teams not interacting enough (fear justified or not)
<tomeu>
I don't see why team coordinators would need to be much more involved in these discussions than other people
<bernie>
there's potential for abuse of course... as there was for the wide-audience slobs
<walterbender>
bernie: can you give a hypothetical example of how it would be used?
<tomeu>
do we have any past situations that support this need?
<SeanDaly>
A media campaign launch :-)
<SeanDaly>
"all hands on deck"
<bernie>
tomeu: for example, getting you and erikos in the loop regarding the nokia deal
<bernie>
tomeu: or the launchpad thing
<SeanDaly>
or, my Osor meeting in which hosting possibilities were discussed (still have to write up a debrief)
<walterbender>
bernie: I am not sure I understand
<walterbender>
each of these cases seems unique. what is the common denominator that a list would address?
<walterbender>
Doesn't each team, e.g., marketing or infrastructure already have a list?
<tomeu>
frankly, I see that proposal dividing more than uniting our community
<SeanDaly>
well, the problem is lack of interaction
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: can you please elaborate?
<SeanDaly>
for example if marketing stuff which impacts development,
<cjb>
tomeu: yes, it does seem to elevate members into "trusted or untrusted", which is often a mistake
<tomeu>
and I don't like the word leader, each team needs a coordinator but several of its members can have a leader role in different areas
<bernie>
walterbender: team leaders is just a way to include everyone who is trusted enough to lead a team
<SeanDaly>
there are problems real quick if developers not in the loop
<bernie>
tomeu: I also see the downside, that's true
<SeanDaly>
at the same time, not all devs want all marketing info all the time
<bernie>
mel: I have a counterproposal - instead of having a teams@ list, make it a req that each team has a slobs in the loop for that team
<SeanDaly>
to put it mildly
<bernie>
i.e. each team would have a "SLOBs ambassador"
<walterbender>
bernie: in theory we have that already.
<walterbender>
it is in our bylaws
<cjb>
SJ was telling me about wikipedia does this
<tomeu>
bernie: as I said, I think we have coordinators, that may be defacto leaders, or not
<cjb>
they say you can *only* start a team if you can find a board member to sit on it, or something
<bernie>
walterbender: in practice, though?
<walterbender>
bernie: for the most part, yes.
<cjb>
so it's sort of the opposite of our decision panel rules; rather than requiring no members of the board, they require at least one
<bernie>
walterbender:if this was implemented well in practice, would it solve our confidentiality issues?
<walterbender>
bernie: infrastruture-you; marketing-sean; etc.
<walterbender>
activities-me
<bernie>
bernie: but we only have 7 people on the board
<walterbender>
and not so many teams either
<bernie>
mel: but a SLOB can be an ambassador for 2 teams if needed
<bernie>
mel asks again: if this was implemented well in practice, would it solve our confidentiality issues?
<cjb>
we can "solve our confidentiality issues" by not being too lazy to write out addresses of individuals on e-mails when we need to, though
<walterbender>
I guess I (a) don't understand what are confidentiality issues are and (b) don't understand how another list would solve the problem I don't understand
<cjb>
and if we do that, we haven't just split our community into people we like and people we don't
<tomeu>
cjb++
<cjb>
at least not in a way that's obvious to them :)
<bernie>
mel: bernie and I just clarified something between us - the "SLOBs ambassadors requirement" for teams would be for a SLOBs person to be actively watching that team, not necessarily leading it
<bernie>
(bernie had thought it was that a SLOB had to be leading the team)
<walterbender>
bernie: in factr, in almost every case, the SLOBs member is NOT the leader, which is a good thing.
<bernie>
mel: cjb++
<cjb>
so my thought is that this proposal has the potential to create much more harm than good
<cjb>
even though I can see that it could create some good
<walterbender>
bernie: is a motion emerging from this discussion?
<bernie>
mel: I'd like to propose the motion that we have SLOBs ambassadors to each team, instead of a teams@ list
<bernie>
bernie: I would agree on that.
<cjb>
what happens in the weird case of no-one wanting to be their ambassador?
<walterbender>
bernie: maybe the motion should be that we ensure that we execute on that structure, which is already in our by-laws
<cjb>
does the ambassador have to go to all that team's meetings?
<SeanDaly>
perhaps it's early to do this. If there were 3x the number of volunteers, i think it would more useful.
<tomeu>
btw, we have teams without coordinators, I don't see how we are talking about this before having found a coordinator for each
<bernie>
mel: cjb: it would be a requirement for a team to have /an/ ambassador, I'd say
<tomeu>
we don't even have a community manager yet
<bernie>
mel: cjb: but how the ambassador and the team interface doesn't have to be strictly defined right now
<SeanDaly>
or an education/content manager...
<cjb>
so, this idea is obviously much less objectionable
<cjb>
but I don't think it solves the same problem
<cjb>
and I don't know that the problem it solves is actually one we have
<bernie>
Adam: i think this is a useful conversation, but I'm not sure if we can encode these responsibilities easily.
* walterbender	deserves the heat because making sure the by-laws are observed is probably the responsibility of the ED
<bernie>
mel: I think this is a good convo to take to Planet as a conversation starter, but we probably can't make much more progress on it right now
<tomeu>
also, the only team with regular meetings is the marketing team
<bernie>
bernie: +1
<bernie>
adam: +1
<cjb>
+1
<SeanDaly>
regular as long as I'm not moving house :D
<tomeu>
and the only other one that has occasional meetings is the dev team
<walterbender>
in any case, it seems we are not planning to move forward with Bernie's original proposal at this time?
<tomeu>
so I don't know what sense makes to say that slobs attends team meetings
<bernie>
mel: that's what I think
<bernie>
bernie: that's fine
<SeanDaly>
I think revisit the topic for the happy day we have enough volunteers that not everybody knows everybody
<bernie>
adam: I do like what mel said - as long as it's not enforced, to have that expectation...
<walterbender>
I will volunteer to crack the whip to ensure we have a mapping between SLOBs and teams.
<bernie>
adam: that the team coordinator builds a social relationship with slobs
<bernie>
mel: moving on then?
<walterbender>
bernie: are you satisfied?
<bernie>
yes
<walterbender>
OK.
<walterbender>
to summarize: we will not implement the teams@ list at this time, but will mae a concerted effrot to ensure that there is SLOBs presence on all teams.
<walterbender>
#TOPIC SoaS DP
<walterbender>
Have any of you on the bus heard back from the DP?
<walterbender>
none of the rest of us have.
<bernie>
all three: no
<walterbender>
:(
<walterbender>
I think this means that we have to dissolve the panel
<walterbender>
as per our discussion last time.
<SeanDaly>
when was deadline again pls?
<walterbender>
today.
<SeanDaly>
yes, disappointing.
<bernie>
mel: ok, so we dissolve the panel and then who handles the decision? slobs?
<cjb>
mel: that would be my preference
<walterbender>
that is what we need to decide
<bernie>
mel: mine as well
<cjb>
I don't think this situation is encoded in our bylaws
<cjb>
so we get to wing it :)
<bernie>
mel: motion - when a DP fails to meet a deadline, the decision passes to slobs
<cjb>
seconded
<walterbender>
discussion?
<cjb>
this seems uncontroversial to me. any objections?
<tomeu>
I thought it was already like that
<walterbender>
in some sense, we already have that responsibility
<cjb>
tomeu: we hadn't really talked about it
<bernie>
bernie: I think we still ought to take into account the consensus of the DP that was summarized in the wiki
<tomeu>
cjb: does the slobs give any power to the dp when it's created?
<cjb>
tomeu: no, not really
<tomeu>
I thought it was only a consultative thing
<cjb>
bernie: I'm not sure about that
<tomeu>
then the slobs have always retained the responsibility of deciding on thast
<SeanDaly>
yes, SLOBs should inspect the status of work even if no consensus reached
<cjb>
of course, whoever proposes a new decision on the topic should read the DP's work first
<walterbender>
the DP is suppose to make a recommendation to SLOBs for some action.
<cjb>
but the DP's work is not complete
<walterbender>
in this case, no recommendation, but lots of fruitful discussion
<walterbender>
we can make a decision based on that input or ask for a new DP
<cjb>
so we shouldn't just take it as gospel or anything. it's just something to read and help educate us.
<bernie>
bernie: cjb: so do we disregard the DP decision even when there was a clear consensus?
<cjb>
bernie: yes.
<cjb>
that's what dissolving the DP means.
<bernie>
cjb: ah, after reading your explanation., I'd tend to agree.
<walterbender>
bernie: and presumably get voted off the island as a result
<cjb>
:)
<bernie>
mel; so i had a motion and cjb seconded it... do we want to discuss it more, or vote?
<bernie>
(that would give us a way to move forward with the DP's decision and actually make a decision)
<walterbender>
I am not sure we need a motion because it is how I would interpret the staus quo, but a motion won't hurt for clarity's sake
<bernie>
mel: motion - when a DP fails to meet a deadline, the decision passes to slobs.
<walterbender>
shall we vote?
<cjb>
aye
<bernie>
mel: aye
<SeanDaly>
aye
<walterbender>
aye
<tomeu>
as I said, I don't understand why we vote this
<bernie>
adam: tends to agree with tomeu
<cjb>
tomeu: it's just a point of clarification
<tomeu>
is it said anywhere that the decision is removed from the slobs at any point?
<cjb>
nope
<cjb>
I think the reason it's slightly unintuitive is:
<cjb>
* The bylaws say we get to solve conflict by starting a decision panel
<tomeu>
well, then I think we need to leave very clearly that the decision is always left to the slobs
<tomeu>
if someone thinks otherwise, it's bad
<cjb>
tomeu: that's what the vote helps to do :)
<cjb>
* and if a DP fails... well, maybe we just start another one or something
<tomeu>
ok, if people think it helps, I vote yes
<bernie>
adam: feels we've already voted on this previously
<cjb>
the vote passed already :)
<cjb>
next up: would someone like to volunteer to review the DP work, and create a motion to solve the original problem with?
<cjb>
it should probably be several of us, or even all of us
<walterbender>
adam: we certainly discussed it last week, but I think we were all holding out for a DP report :(
<walterbender>
cjb: yes. I think that is the next step in regard to this particular issue.
<bernie>
FYI: This computer will die in less than 5 min
<cjb>
heh
<bernie>
bernie, mel, adam will be offline then
<walterbender>
and I think we should make a decision next week.
<bernie>
Be quick!
<cjb>
bernie: which of you wants to be involved in coming up with a decision on the DP work?
<cjb>
walterbender: make a decision on the original request, right?
<walterbender>
#ACTION: everyone reviews the DP work and comes prepared next week to discuss and decide.
<cjb>
ok
<cjb>
it might be good to have the motions available before the meeting
<walterbender>
if there are questions, raise them BEFORE the meeting to the list
<bernie>
bernie: cjb: I'll leave this hot potato to someone else :)
<cjb>
so if folks could e-mail them as they come up with them
<cjb>
that'd be good
<walterbender>
by list, I mean iaep [SLOBS]
<cjb>
I'll volunteer to try to review all their stuff and think about it/come up with a motion
<cjb>
would be good if others can too
<walterbender>
thanks cjb
<bernie>
bernie: cjb: mel is currently busy with fudbus business
<cjb>
any other urgent business for this meeting?
<walterbender>
just discussion, I think
<SeanDaly>
well, I wanted to know if possible put e-books in ASLO
<walterbender>
the policies re ebooks, acitvities, etc
<walterbender>
and of course, the trademark issue
<cjb>
oh, yes!
<bernie>
adam: agreed..i'll remind SJ & Caryl to weigh in if they have final thoughts on DP's wiki page, even if defunct
<SeanDaly>
I haven't thought deeply on implications, was caught short with licensing issue
<cjb>
motion: no non-free software or content on ASLO, as judged by DFSG/OSI
<walterbender>
but we will have to carry on without our FUDCon friends :(
<cjb>
fudbus folks, what'd you think?
<walterbender>
#TOPIC non-FOSS content
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: it may be more convenient if we found one or more partners who wanted to take the content side of all this
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: so we don't have to spread ourselves too thin
<bernie>
bernie: ok, switching battery
<SeanDaly>
no, the context is helping parents/teachers get started with e-books
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: so not solving the whole content problem but some first step?
<SeanDaly>
there are hundreds, thousands out there, idea is to help newbies use in Sugar
<SeanDaly>
yes, first step
<SeanDaly>
we wstarted wiki page for that
<walterbender>
this parallels the debate we had at OLPC re content.
<SeanDaly>
wiki page may be better than ASLO
<walterbender>
we can never do more than plant seeds
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: so maybe there's enough free content out there?
<walterbender>
and show others how to take initiative
<SeanDaly>
tomeu: there's a vast amount, but when there isn't any with Sugar or close by, it's a technical barrier
<SeanDaly>
idea is to have a few available, so people can try ereaders
<walterbender>
I don't believe it is our mission to solve the content problem, but lowering technical and culture barriers is our mission
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: I mean, there isn't enough free content to "solve the whole content problem", but there may be enough free content for that first step
<SeanDaly>
and hint how to search in repositories, online etc.
<SeanDaly>
tomeu: yes, we had put effort into finding a dozen nice books in half a dozen languages
<SeanDaly>
idea is to make first step easy: find, obtain, what format, which Activity
<walterbender>
what is the SLOBs issue here? seems we are drifting off topic
<tomeu>
ok, so do we need to tackle the issue of non-free content on aslo right now?
<cjb>
walterbender: I made a motion and everything :)
<cjb>
there are two issues, related:
<cjb>
* someone wants to put Skype etc on ASLO
<cjb>
* someone wants to put non-free ebooks on ASLO
<walterbender>
tomeu: yes in that there are some non-free activities waiting for approval
<SeanDaly>
issue was: ASLO a place for content bundles?
<tomeu>
oh, ok
<cjb>
in both cases this was kinda reasonable, because there was no-one saying "oh, we have a policy against doing those"
<bernie>
bernie: back in business
<tomeu>
in the skype case, I guess it's plain ilegal, even if we really wanted to do that, right?
<cjb>
tomeu: yes
<tomeu>
and is there any other non-free but freely-distributable software proposed for aslo?
<cjb>
tomeu: just the content, I think
<walterbender>
bernie:
http://pastebin.be/22311
<bernie>
mel: we do not have a license policy on what can go on ASLO, right?
<SeanDaly>
piles of flash stuff?
<cjb>
SeanDaly: flash stuff can be free
<cjb>
bernie: right -- currently no
<cjb>
bernie: we'd be creating one now
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: but isn't most flash stuff out there without any license info at all?
<tomeu>
so we don't really know if it's actually freely-distributable
<SeanDaly>
cjb: free as in 4 freedoms?
<cjb>
SeanDaly: legally, yes
<cjb>
you can make a Flash app and release it under the GPL
<bernie>
I'd like to have something like
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing
<SeanDaly>
huge amount of free-online in Flash has no license info,
<cjb>
I still think flash apps don't provide useful versions of the four freedoms, but that's a much more subtle point
<bernie>
which includes a list of acceptable licenses,
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Good_Licenses
<bernie>
(this is Mel)
<cjb>
SeanDaly: sure, I agree
<SeanDaly>
I think because offline Flash difficult so always assumed to be online
<walterbender>
cjb: not sure where you put or access the license info in Flash
<bernie>
mel: basically, have a legal req for content posted on ASLO (possibly extend that to other things that SL distributes, but ASLO seems to be the issue at present)
<cjb>
Mel: We could do that, or just adopt the DFSG/OSI rules
<cjb>
Mel: The advantage of using the rules is that they cope with new licenses as well as current ones.
<bernie>
mel: I'm happy with any non-ambiguous statement of what we do and don't allow license-wise, honestly.
<cjb>
walterbender: that's a good point
<bernie>
cjb: link?
<cjb>
http://opensource.org/docs/osd
<bernie>
mel: that sounds like a good idea to me though
<cjb>
the Debian Free Software Guidelines are basically identical
<cjb>
MOTION: adopt
http://opensource.org/docs/osd
as the source for what is permitted on ASLO, for both software and content
<bernie>
bus riders are looking at the link, one sec
<SeanDaly>
I'd rather read that first before voting on anything
<cjb>
ok. we could postpone.
<walterbender>
so another homework assignment so we can vote next week?
<bernie>
mel: I'm good with the list
<bernie>
mel: I've read it already
<tomeu>
and I guess SFC has a say on this?
<walterbender>
but we seem to have consensus on the basic idea?
<tomeu>
because relates to their mission?
<cjb>
tomeu: yes. we mentioned the idea that we might distribute something that isn't on this list (ebooks under CC noncommercial license), and they decided they'd have to talk to their board about it
<walterbender>
I'll check with the SFC. They owe us a response re NC and ND licenses already :)
<cjb>
so I'm sure they're very much in agreement with the motion
<cjb>
(that was about SoaS, though, not ASLO)
<bernie>
bernie: cjb: while I agree with the OSI definition of what constitutes an open source license, I'd much prefer a list of acceptable licenses rather than a set of rules that would force us to go through a lawyer every time we see a new license.
<cjb>
bernie: both are useful, neither are sufficient
<walterbender>
bernie:
http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical
<cjb>
bernie: if someone proposes Skype
<walterbender>
that is a list
<bernie>
mel: they're not incompatible, we can say "our legal thing is the OSD, here's a list of licenses we know fit these criteria, new ones come talk to us."
<cjb>
and I can't find "the Skype license" in Fedora's list
<SeanDaly>
ASLO is response to SoaS problem
<cjb>
I need a way to reject it
<bernie>
mel: walterbender: exactly
<cjb>
(legally happened to work in this example)
<cjb>
but anyway, many times random non-free software might be proposed
<cjb>
it won't always have a license on that list, or a license at all
<cjb>
so the motion helps by giving community guidelines on what *type* of software is permitted
<cjb>
let's rephrase, though:
<cjb>
MOTION: adopt
http://opensource.org/docs/osd
as a set of guidelines for what is permitted on ASLO, for both software and content, and
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing#Good_Licenses's
opinions on specific licenses where applicable
<cjb>
bernie: does that cover your concern?
<walterbender>
cjb: this still skirts the other issue though: does the content or s'ware abide by community standards... a tough one.
<bernie>
bernie: cjb aye
<SeanDaly>
I cannot rush into a vote without reading and understanding that page.
<cjb>
SeanDaly: that's fine. I won't push you to.
<SeanDaly>
Something I can't do in the next 30 seconds.
<bernie>
mel: Table for next meeting, reading homework for next week?
<cjb>
SeanDaly: I just want the motion to be clear.
<bernie>
mel: I'll take the homework assignment of blogging this so that others pick up on it on Planet (and hopefully Fedora folks can chime in as well)
<bernie>
(and $otherdistros if we can get them)
<walterbender>
OK. I think we have enough background now to move quickly to a decision next week.
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: yes
<cjb>
mel: thanks!
<cjb>
that's a good idea
<bernie>
#action mchua to blog licensing motion
<walterbender>
OK. Next topic? We have about 5 more minutes.
<bernie>
#action everyone to do their homework of reading OSD guidelines so we can be informed voters next Friday
<bernie>
mel: yeah, let's move on
<walterbender>
#ACTION mel blog and the rest of us do homework with the intention of deciding next week
walterbender	thinks only the person who typed #startmeeting can #action
<bernie>
we'll find out :)
<walterbender>
#TOPIC trademark
<bernie>
walterbender: thanks for raising the nasty "community standards" issue we'll laaaater have to face..
<bernie>
(adam)
<walterbender>
we have a number of outstanding trademark policies to reach consensus on.
<bernie>
mel: can we line up the to-do list on those and then break for the week with homework? I don't think we have enough time to discuss and vote on anything else atm
<walterbender>
adam: yes. an important, thorny topic.
<walterbender>
mel: I agree.
<SeanDaly>
very thorny indeed
<bernie>
mel: and honestly ASLO licensing is kind of a big deal so if we line that up for next week's Big Goal I'm pretty happy
<walterbender>
I'd like everyone to come to the next meeting with some opinion re the trademark usage.
<walterbender>
from my homework, it seems the two extremes are Fedora and Suse
<bernie>
mel: proposal everyone blog their opinion or email it to iaep
<walterbender>
to gist: Fedora will let anything be called a remix, but almost nothing be called Fedora
<cjb>
Fedora's not actually that extreme, because it offers both models:
<cjb>
.. yeah, those. :)
<walterbender>
openSuse will not allow remix at all
<cjb>
it's easy to be a Remix, and it's hard to be Fedora
<bernie>
mel: we need to do more about starting discussion on slobs issues beyond the 7 of us imo
<walterbender>
cjb: yes. that is what I was trying to say
<SeanDaly>
concerning trademark, there are several kilos worth of e-mails in the lists
<walterbender>
and to contrast that with openSUSE, which as far as I understand, really doesn't have a remix option
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: yes. it is time to distill it all into a policy
<SeanDaly>
yes, fully aggree
<SeanDaly>
s/gg/g
<bernie>
bernie: walterbender, cjb: I'd like to point out that the fedora trademark policy is one of the strictest among linux distros
<walterbender>
bernie: seeming not as strict as openSUSE.
<bernie>
mel: I'd like to propose we wrap up this meeting
<SeanDaly>
my instinct is to look at trademark policy of better-known brands
<walterbender>
bernie: can you give an example of a less strict policy for us to consider?
<bernie>
mel: proposal - next week do ASLO and only ASLO - anything else we do is bonus... immediately after ASLO, then tackle trademark.
<cjb>
hm
<walterbender>
(everyone was going to research one for today's meeting)
<bernie>
mel: notes that bernie and I have to go to the infra meeting immediately after this
<cjb>
mel: this is instead of doing the SoaS DP next week?
<cjb>
I don't know why we'd prioritize something that's been a problem for a week over something that's been a problem for like four months :)
<walterbender>
I think we need to do both. the ASLO discussion will be quick.
<bernie>
cjb: because I think we can wrap up ASLO next week cleanly and be done with it
<walterbender>
(I predict)
<bernie>
(mel)
<cjb>
yeah, +1 on walter
<bernie>
mel: then I'd like to do ASLO first ;)
<bernie>
if we think it'll be that quick
<walterbender>
but we should wrap up today's meeting.
<cjb>
well, okay.. yeah, was about to say that too
<SeanDaly>
There is a current case of trademark usage
<cjb>
(what mel said)
