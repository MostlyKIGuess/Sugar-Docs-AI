Using a 13.2.0 image and installing rpms.
Using sugar-build

Installing Sugar 0.100 testing rpms
The first step is to install a 13.2.0 image, downloaded
here
.
The second step is to create a file
/etc/yum.repos.d/au1b-updates.repo
with the following contents:
[au1b-updates]
name=au1b-udates
baseurl=
http://harvest.one-education.org/public/au1b-updates/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
Later you need to run these commands:
rpm -e sugar-update-control
yum update
If you want a fresh start, and do not care about LOSING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IN YOUR JOURNAL, you can execute this command:
rm -rf .sugar
And finally, restart your computer.
Using sugar-build
