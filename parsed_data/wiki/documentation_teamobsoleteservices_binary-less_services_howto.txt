Work flow for services that don't require a compilation stage, thus, they could be just packaged and used as is on server side:
Create a local, initial service.info file by invoking
0sugar init
, then tweak the newly created
service/service.info
file.
Increase/change the version field in the
service.info
file.
Execute
0sugar dist
to change the local feed in
dist/
and place the tarball there.
Run
0sugar push stable
to rsync changed files from
dist/
to the server.
See
