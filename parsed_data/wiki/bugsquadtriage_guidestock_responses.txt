Thanks for taking the time to report this bug. This bug report isn't very useful because it doesn't describe the bug well. If you have time and can still reproduce the bug, please read
http://sugarlabs.org/go/BugSquad/BugHowto
and add a more useful description to this bug.
If the bug is in an obsolete version of the application
Thanks for taking the time to report this bug. However, you are using a version that is too old and not supported anymore. Sugar developers are no longer working on that version, so unfortunately there will not be any bug fixes for the version that you use.
By upgrading to a newer version of Sugar you could receive bug fixes and new functionality. You may need to upgrade your Linux distribution to obtain a newer version of Sugar.
Please feel free to reopen this bug if the problem still occurs with a newer version of Sugar.
If the bug is not in Sugar
Thanks for taking the time to report this bug. However, this application does not track its bugs in the Sugar tracker. We kindly ask you to report the bug to the application authors.
If the affected third party application has a bug tracking system you should investigate whether a bug for the reported issue is already filed in this system. If it has not been filed yet please do so. Also ensure that both bug reports contain a link to each other.
Thanks in advance!
