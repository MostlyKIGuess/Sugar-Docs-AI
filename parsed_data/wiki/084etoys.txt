Introduction
Etoys is ...
an educational tool for teaching children powerful ideas in compelling ways
a media-rich authoring environment and visual programming system
a free software program that works on almost all personal computers
This activity is the Sugar version of Etoys, which is compatible with the versions running on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

What is new for users
This release fixes many minor bugs and updates translations, but there are no big visible changes.
Getting Started
Starts with the Cloud view. Click on the tutorial cloud. The first challenge in Sugar Etoys asks user to create a simple script and click on a clock to get it going. Try to complete the tutorial. To get to a 'clean version' of the Etoys Challenge go to the Cloud view and click on Tutorials and Demos. Etoys SHOULD load a clean version for you complete with scripting blocks ready to go.
known bugs
Audio recording will sometimes crash etoys. (Trying to reproduce now.)
Audio doesn't play:

Questions
Is there any provision for hosting student projects/ code as being done for
Scratch
? If not, has anyone identified an alternative place for hosting or posting the _ascii text_ student code developed in etoys?
How do you view the source code for etoys projects?
What other ways are there to share etoys made by students outside of their Sugar friends?
Does anyone have any etoy code that gives the illusion of scrolling X and Y?
How do you view the source for etoys in Sugar? The frame rollover right click view source only show the script calling for etoys to start.

How do you enable the preferences so that you can edit code for an etoy project in text mode?

Is there a code block for activating key board control? If yes, where is it under what subset?
When creating a test I want to use a script1 for Yes, and script2 for No. How do I do that? I have not been able to drag and drop the scripts into the test area.
Click the eye ball viewer. Look for scripts. Drag your script block from the viewer and the script block into your test. Etoys is touchy and the UI for handling the blocks, compared to
Scratch
, is clumsy but it can be done. Here's a
video of how to get get scripts into test blocks
.

What is new for developers
The activity source code was moved to
http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/etoys
This version of Sugar includes the Etoys 4.0 release. The major version jump signifies the end of the two-year Etoys relicensing effort.
Originally released in 1996, Apple relicensed the Squeak core under the Apache 2.0 license in October 2006. Then, Viewpoints Research collected written relicensing agreements from several hundred later contributors under the MIT license.  Finally, all the code in Etoys not explicitly covered by a relicensing agreement was removed, or rewritten, or reverted to an earlier version.
The new release is now fully covered by the MIT license, with some portions remaining under the Apache 2.0 license.
