Sugar Digest
1. Amidst all the heated discussion about software licenses, it is worth stepping back a moment to see what people are actually doing on the ground with Sugar. Check out
http://proyectofedora.org/argentina/?p=320
for an example of how Turtle Art has been modified by some of our end users!!  Free Software rocks.
2. I somehow misread the race schedule: the Sugar Labs team is not returning to Uruguay for the Vuelta de Uruguay this year (Team Chipolte/Sugar Labs won the Ruta de la Americas in Uruguay earlier this year). Nonetheless, we will continue with our plans to engage the children of Uruguay in participating in the race. With help from Ceibal Jam, RAP Ceibal,
El Pais
, RIT, and the Sugar Labs marketing team, we now have a site enabled for blogging about the race (See
http://www.sugarlabs.org/vueltaciclista
).
3. While we were looking the other way, we surpassed 5 million activity downloads on the Sugar Labs activity server.
4. In a follow-up exercise to the
Massachusetts 4th Grade Math project
, Claudia Urrea and I have been developing a correlation between Sugar activities and the Florida 4th Grade math curriculum (See
Math4Team/Florida
). Also, check out
the preliminary write up on the Assessment Summit
(more details to follow).

5. Cynthia Solomon has put her excellent book, co-authored by Margaret Minsky and Brian Harvey, on Logo programming,
LogoWorks: Challenging Programs in Logo
, on line (See
http://logoworks.wikispaces.com/
). There is also a very nice preface by Marvin Minsky (
http://logoworks.wikispaces.com/Preface
). All the the examples can be run in Turtle Blocks.
6. Don't miss EduJam (May 5-7) and Sugar Camp (May 8-9) in Montevideo.
