Figure out why so many control panels require restarting Sugar, and fix them not to (MEDIUM)
:
Because we use GConf for settings, we should be able to setup callbacks to be invoked on any change.
(check with Hemanshu?)
DONE
kill the "Mute" function on the volume icon in the frame (EASY)
:
I can't think of a useful use-case for it, and children often manage to turn on muting by simply clicking on the speaker icon (which is a lame UI, btw). If we remove this feature, we have to unconditionally unmute on startup! (Gary agreed and asked to file a ticket)

Power has only 2 options, they could go into a context menu on the battery icon in the frame
Backup/restore -> journal (or a schoolserver icon in the mesh view)
accessibility -> fold into keyboard
modem config -> context menu on the modem icon in the frame
