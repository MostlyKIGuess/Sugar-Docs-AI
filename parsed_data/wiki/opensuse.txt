Quoted from the webpage:
"openSUSE Education team is proud to present openSUSE-Edu Li-f-e (Linux for Education) based on openSUSE 12.3.
The image is a "hybrid" iso image, the same image can be used to burn a Live DVD or to create a Live USB stick.
This release includes carefully selected software for students, educators as well as parents.
The software selection encompasses everything required to make computers productive for either home or educational use without having to install anything additional.
The Live DVD contains KIWI-LTSP server that can be enabled even by non-technical user, it comes bundled with tons of useful applications from openSUSE Education, Build Service and Packman repositories.
With the KIWI-LTSP server you can PXE(network) boot other PCs to use this live DVD without installing or modifying anything on them. Booting from hard disk again will leave those PCs as they were.
(Please note that running LTSP from Live DVD/USB is meant for demo/testing purpose only, install on the hard disk to use it in production). "

Some other problems are:
1. DrGeoII failed to start.
2. Cursor in Story Builder does not display properly.
3. Speak runs a bit slow. (not sure if it is a problem)
4. Record failed to record audio.
5. Jukebox failed to play audio.

To add Ubuntu iso to the stick, run the following:
   export distroname=ubuntu
   live-fat-stick /path/to/ubuntu-filename.iso /dev/sdXY
isopath should be full absolute path of iso image and the device should be 
actual partition on the stick like /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1,/dev/sdc2...
The stick partition has to be vfat/fat32 format.
run live-fat-stick -l to list the possible usb sticks available.
It is possible to boot multiple iso images from same stick,
