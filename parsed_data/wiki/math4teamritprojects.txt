FileShare is an activity that allows the user to share files from their journal.
The activity prompts the user for a list of files. When a user joins the shared activity, they are shown the file list where they can choose which files they would like to download. Files may also be uploaded to a central server if it is running a compatible script.

Lemonade stand (or more likely, *Insert produce here* stand) is a collaboration project at RIT. It is designed to test children on fractions, working with money, estimation, and other math topics. While our time restraints limit the extent to which we can implement features, the current goal is a feature complete program even if lacking in graphics. We plan on having a system based on buying and selling commodities and an eventual season based economy.
The largest and most complex task of the project will be the introduction of a basic AI to handle the economy, more graphics, and localization.  We are planning on introducing the game with a generic currency model while being easy to replace for regional types.
Lemonade Stand is taking a short hiatus following the 2.1 release to identify the next series of features to implement for the next release.

This project is one of
many small projects
focused on developing 4th grade math games which will run on the OLPC XO. We are
RIT students
who are working on this with the help of other developers who become interested in our projects.
The focus of this project is to turn an existing game (
Assimilate
) into a math based flash card game which will hopefully be included on future XO's.

Fun Towers is a pre-existing game that can be found online in several version (
http://www.funnytowers.com/
is one example) that has been ported to the XO, written in Squeak. Our team is modifying this purely numerical/card based game into one that can be used as a teaching tool as part of the 4th grade math project.
Our initial goals in modifying the pre-existing game remain relatively simple and achievable, and our goal is to produce verifiable results that can be used to point to the very preliminary success of the math4 program, while more in-depth projects are still in development.
The game itself is simple, users are given a card and with it are able to remove from one of 3 pyramids of cards a card that is one greater or one lower in value. This card that has been removed is the users new card, and any cards that were covered by the removed card are now in play.

Muthris is a math themed, Tetris-based game inspired by Cuyo. Players control falling blocks which must be grouped in certain math related ways in-order to clear that grouping from the board.  The level is lost when the board fills up with blocks.  Players learn math skills by fun repetition of simple mathematical problems and the grouping of sets of numbers.  Levels are abstracted away from the core game.  This allows one to simple drop in new levels and learn different mathematical concepts.

The player is Arthur's Royal Detective. The goal is retrieve all the knights who are in the middle of their most famous quests for a banquet at Camelot. The game is a "point and click" game in the same vein as Monkey Island and King's Quest. The user reads dialog, hunts for an item on screen, and figures out who to use the item on. This causes a reaction and new areas open, etc.

The object of the game is to solve a system of equations with unknowns represented by fruits. The player is given the column sums and row sums, and from there he must determine the value of each fruit. The game difficulty can be changed, and it ranges from solving 3x3 fruit equations, all the way up to 9x9 fruit grids.

The purpose of the Question Support API is to provide a unified method for Activities to access standardized format question files. The API currently supports the use of multiple choice questions with a single correct answer and no partial credit. Currently, the API only reports questions in a plain text format from Moodle format question files.

The XO school Server, or XS, is one of the products of the OLPC project, designed to complement the XO laptop. It is a Linux-based OS (a Fedora-based distribution) engineered to be installed on generic low-end servers. 
When we deploy one laptop per child, we must also provide additional infrastructure extending the capabilities of the laptops. While the laptops are self-sufficient for many learning activities, other activities and services depend on the School Server providing connectivity, shared resources and services. Services, tools and activities running on the School Server allow asynchronous interaction, can use larger storage capacity, and take advantage of the processing power of the XS.

Our goal is to allow results and / or grades, from student activities to be readily available to teachers.
- Based on their wants and needs,teachers can then generate custom reports on a class or Individual. Teachers Have the ability to determine what types of problems students are finding most difficult. 
- Additionally we envision logic in the module which analyses student activity and checks for a  yes
