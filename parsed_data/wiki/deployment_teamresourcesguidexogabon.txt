The law 16/66 of 9 August 1966 on the organization of education in the Republic
Gabon, in Article 3 stipulates that "education must ensure the physical,
intellectual, moral and civic future of citizen [...] "In Article 5, one can read" the
teaching methods using all modern means of more appropriate
lectures. The programs will be based on social conditions and
and their economic development. " To dock with these requirements, the purposes
Education school gabonaise address the objectives of integration (in reference to
the establishment of the aproche by basic skills.
Since the 1990s, these guidelines attempt to consolidate knowledge, skills and
knowledge being essential to education, education and training of all citizens,
development actor. Indeed, the integration of ICT into the school system is more
show views of the many initiatives undertaken by the policy on this subject. This is the
why the student in the Master's in Science Education
Laval University of Quebec in collaboration with the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) in
Libreville, offers a guide to implementation of educational XO (small green computer produced by the Foundation One Laptop per Child (OLPC), as the concept of Nicholas
Negroponte) aimed
particularly to teachers and future teachers and
teachers of primary, regardless of class maintenance and educational activities
considered.
The purpose of this guide is to contribute to the effective integration of XO in the system
Gabonese education beginning with primary education.
This study guide and inform the teacher is used, depending on the activities of XO, landmarks
animation class. It can find tracks of activities around different themes
content in the curricula of primary school gabonaise.
It may also be of interest politics in order to establish an education policy which
advocates strengthening the capacity for technological literacy, deepening
knowledge and creation of knowledge, approaches proposed and supported by the
Standards UNESCO ICT competences of teachers.
Finally, this study guide can help the student at the center of all
learning activities, development of interdisciplinary skills related to
life, he is placed in the center of all activities carried out under
learning.
Introduction
For years, Gabon has committed in the fight against poverty. This
Indeed, he placed one of its priorities "Quality education for all."
Strengthening and revision of content, as well as the updating of
mechanisms for assessing learners undertaken as the primary demonstration
of this resolution.
In this perspective, the integration of XO in the education system must be gabonais
be in line with the established curriculum on the skills to develop.
Indeed, the new primary school provision gabonaise Profile
skills of the person to form, ie after a learning cycle
considered in the learner's ability to perform a task or solve situations
problems adequately, using relevant knowledge and including also
sizes cognitive, affective, psychomotor and social. In this case, the student learns to
integrate its acquired french, mathematics, and in waking life situations
common. The XO, by its configuration, as it shows the student center and its
learning all around him, can help students to better strengthen its achievements.
As a result, the value of XO in the context of the PCA is essentially three
levels: to give meaning to learning, making learning more effective set
greater achievements. The XO can be considered as round as a didactic
in connection with the specification of situations targeted by the student and the integration module and
dock operation of the PCA. Because the competency-based approach aims at
Child behavior problem solving situation, the XO will integrate
learning process as an additional methodological. In this
perspective, a reminder of how the CPA and its Methodological tools
will clarify the adequacy of the XO.
Indeed, competency-based approach seeks to give meaning to learning through
a framework for resolution of significant problems (as target problems), use
grids of evaluation criteria reliable, objective and customized through the use
Planning an airy, consistent and appropriate to the context. In terms of tools, there are
the existence of methodological tools and physical media. The first cover
aspects of learning content (knowledge, know-how, skills), examples
activities, location problem (problem of life and therefore complex
meaningful to the learner, mobilizing all resources, knowledge, know-how,
of skills). The latter include amongst others the curriculum (combination
by the purposes, content, skills, teaching methods and modalities
Evaluation of a training course); guide integration (all directions
teaching made available to the teacher to assess the child and the book
situation (in which the activities planned for integration). According to the XO
design condenses these components both in terms of functionality
and in the implementation of activities made visible in the light of
different affordances explained to the first chapter of this guide. The XO could be
used in both training exercises in the resolution of situations
problems of integration. In other words, exercises and situations
problems will be placed on the USB key by the developer so that the learner at the end of a cycle
learning to serve. The current physical media can serve as a benchmark for
all these creations.
This guide (which needs to be improved by all educational contributions) can be used by school children and adults
XO users in the training of resource persons who will be experts
to train a large number of educators. It presents in its pages a recent
glossary is not exhaustive and is primarily composed of three chapters
respectively trace the first integration of ICT in schools to
the XO and the need for their use in all modern societies that aspire to
all-out development, taking into account the educational purposes of each
nation. Then it contains a broad description of activities used in
learning and teaching indicates applications that may be made
school curricula in accordance with the Gabonese. And finally, the last chapter is a
springboard to explore the pedagogy of the project when using the XO. These projects with
themes are located can discuss possible solutions to problems
the environment of the student Gabon.
Chapter 1
Based on the premise that information technology and communication are a
and pervasive challenge in the 21st century, where it has invaded all
sectors. The computer becomes a tool for promoting and
deepening and the creation of knowledge. The school institution for the training of
future citizens and it is open with the ambition to become familiar with this tool. In
level, initiatives have flourished, and before any official devote
ICT in schools. Today, these tools have become indispensable to the point where
is no longer a "modern" without them. ICT has made a
spectacular in education to become a teaching tool and
education with which we must join if we do not want to fall behind
in the evolution and development of the world of education. It is in this context that the
skills in ICT and especially the micro-computer for both
teachers for students in context is a matter of importance. The meaning
the advent of XO in primary lies therefore in the initiation of students to the culture of
knowledge creation in the early years of schooling. We ask
However, the question, what is the relevance of ICTs in
teaching methods, but also in teaching methods and
learning? To do this, we entreverrons:
The educational purposes;
The metaphor underlying the design of the XO operating system;
The relevance and burden associated with the introduction of IT in
school context.
The educational purposes
In the law 16/66 of 9 August 1966:
In its 5th section, this Act provides that "teaching methods use all
modern means appropriate in addition to lectures. The programs will be
based social and economic conditions and trends. "
The loi16/66 of 9 August 1966 on the organization of education in Gabon, states
3rd Article: "The education must ensure the physical, intellectual,
moral and civic future citizens. It must contribute to national unity and cohesion
social, thanks to information and exchange of information with other bodies
the state. " Education must therefore provide the individual training multidimensional. The
educational policy in Gabon seeks development, social integration and
economic citizen. It should make the student to develop their curiosity about
of society and the world around them better by openness, but also
participate in economic and social development of his country.
In its 5th section, this Act (16/66) stipulates that "teaching methods
using all modern means appropriate in addition to lectures. In this,
ICT is a good response to these expectations. With this in mind that policies
educational advocate the strengthening of technological education, but also
integration of IT in schools. The integration of ICT in context
school is not subject to any challenge in Gabon, judging by the many projects
undertaken.
The school must gabonaise train citizens happy, able to master a certain
amount of knowledge (scientific, technical) to fit into the social fabric and
economic, and thus to participate in economic and social development. It should form
women and men with a sense of responsibility, able to act, to invent and
to create in all fields. Education must prepare people to cope with
needs of new technology required the development of a country at a time
given.
Curricula designed to build knowledge, skills, and knowledge being essential to
instruction, education and training of citizens, development actor. These
curricula designed to help students not only to build a range of knowledge
interdisciplinary in order to make him a competent player, capable of contributing to
socio-economic development of the nation, to cope with possible problems
may impede this development.
As defined, the objectives and purposes of education are largely gabonais
up to the introduction of a project such as the XO, since the hour is to
reforms. The integration of ICT in schools is a political willingness
Gabon, to judge by the many projects undertaken in this direction. This project
progressive integration of ICT in schools aims to redefine the place and
role of the tool, which could be a plus for the mental processes beyond
it is instrumental, in exercising its influence on our modes of thought and
learning. In this regard, the failure of attempts to introduce the tool
in school, particularly that of 2001 could be explained by the dislocation
between ICT and the curriculum. The introduction of the XO in a school context, especially in
primary schools is to "make a difference in terms of education
enabling teachers, as well as students turn their
relation to knowledge "(Désautels, 2008).
From that moment, it would be interesting to look a little to the metaphor
which inspired the design of the operating system XO. For, it must be said, this design
responds adequately to the expectations of the conceptual framework of theories which underlie
new methods and theories of education.
The metaphor underlying the design of the operating system of XO
The design of the XO meets a number of requirements and need because it
This fusion of active teaching theories. The design of the operating system
the XO is based methods to both constructivist, socio-constructivist and
constructionist. It places the student at the center of the learning process. If one refers to the
constructionist conception of Papert (1981), the XO is designed to be used in order
to improve learning among students, and even if we can not say that
As well as teaching methods, we believe that the
posture methodology behind the design of the XO (constructivism and
socio). Product of constructivism, the XO place the learner at the center of
activities as advocated by Piaget: the affordances lead the learner to build his
own knowledge through the activities that the developer offered him such activity "
draw. As socio-product, it allows the learner to achieve
certain activities in synchronized example, functions "discuss" or "writing" that
bring into learner interaction and the other, integrating the vision vigotskienne.
The design of the XO operating system is like a tool case. In other words,
a box containing activities allowing students to construct their own knowledge. The project
educational proposed (XO) addresses the need to train the actors of a class to a
collaborative logic different from the individualistic dominant logic in the system
gabonais education. The XO is the movement of discoveries in neuroscience that
have highlighted the relationship between age and the learning process: the more one is
exposed to early learning, there are more opportunities to learn and master
(OECD, 2008). This is as above constructionist theories,
and social-constructivist.
This tool facilitates the creation of knowledge among students in relation to its
environment and through exchanges with other subjects. These theories of learning
give an emphasis on collaboration which refer to the purposes outlined
above. The metaphor of the circular presentation of the activities offered by the XO and
centrality of the learner allows the latter to resort to activities of a
variety. It may solicit and share them with peers, teachers or
the teacher at any time, thus developing skills: collaboration and
sharing - to name a few - by interacting with its environment. The
know it becomes a forge built and know not taught.
In a classroom, the teacher who claims to constructivism or
socio must take account of differences between the different contexts and promote
a dynamic relationship to knowledge, ie to reflect the students, lead to
construct arguments, but also knowledge and XO fall within this perspective.
The elements of relevance
The Gabonese education system can not evolve in isolation, in that it must open and
comply with international standards as recommended by UNESCO and OECD.
According to the OECD, the XO will allow the student to have access to a personalized learning - on
extent - in particular by increasing its potential for reformulation of questions
learning or to direct peers, or to the teacher. There has intensified
interactions.
The introduction of the XO in line with the projects of UNESCO and the OECD puts an emphasis
particularly on reducing poverty and improving the quality of life by putting
related ICT, education reform and growth. Furthermore, the magic of XO allows
learners to collaborate with other actors in its immediate environment through
"The grid", but to seek, via the Internet of people belonging to
more distant universe. The XO is for teaching, but also for the student a working tool
effective as the metaphor of the electronic book, far more attractive than
traditional types of media. In this sense, the databases and activities of XO
would be more affordable in terms of cost relative to the establishment of libraries,
management and regular renewal. The same applies to the student, his attitude to be XO
different than a face that traditional tools (notebooks, slates, books, etc..), because
more attractive. According to the results of PISA show that "cooperation
positive relationship between student performance and their attitude vis-à-vis the learning "
(EDU / CERI / CD, 2008). With the XO, the student can judge its capabilities and evaluate its achievements in
same time as learning (formative assessment) rather than wait for the
summative.
For the Gabonese education system, the tics are a lever to change the school, both
in the construction of knowledge and level of communication from them.
The XO promote personalized training marginal pedagogy
Overview of the classroom. Its use would facilitate group work and involve
initiatives and individual and collective responsibilities. ICT travel time
and location of school (connectivity, support at any time, information
unlimited) and can thus lead and place it "everywhere." They change the report to
knowledge and the role of the teacher in the classroom.
Using the XO bousculant school organization as we know it
today: its contents examined, the kinds of work students and teachers.
This will certainly lead to a number of benefits and constraints.
Constraints with which compose
While the introduction of IT (XO) in middle school offers a number
of advantages, it would be unrealistic to say that any coercion n'induira.
Indeed, the school gabonaise of certain problems: overcrowding (60-100 students);
lack of teaching materials, lack of teachers and teachers; disparities
between institutions; disparity in the treatment of teachers and laxity
government regarding the implementation and application of reforms. These
constraints above do not militate in favor of greater integration of XO
Gabon in school.
How the teacher could initiate such XO to a hundred students
simultaneously? Each child is under these conditions have a computer? In
Speaking of outdated facilities in our schools, how to use the XO
in classes sometimes missing the strict minimum - electricity -?
Last but not least, it is important to address the labor group whose XO is the promoter.
How to ensure the success of the collective individual success? Indeed,
collective performance can be possible without the partners of these individuals
interactions are progressing at a subsequent work. It must, to paraphrase Vygotsky,
wait for the interpersonal process is transformed into an intrapersonal process.
We must also tackle the reluctance of teachers locked in paradigms in which they
do not want to get rid of and reluctance to accept political
difficult, if rarely innovative initiatives coming from the base. Similarly,
Ministry of Education seems to have condemned the teaching status too
reducer running programs denying any personal initiative.
The integration of XO to the school environment will require commitment by teachers and
teachers renewed patience and a change in teaching. It should
to accept that several tasks are performed in class at the same time, it
must therefore be creative in varying activities. This project will require
also from the political authorities of the appropriate training of teachers
and teachers - both those of primary and high school - the postures, but
also to the theories underlying the design and use of the XO in context
school. In summary, if the introduction of the XO meets a real need, it requires a
deep reflection on the purposes and on current teaching practices.
The integration of ICT, especially the XO Primary School, is a
very important. It meets the current requirements
learning, especially those who want that learning is related
age as evidenced in science learning.
The remarkable work of CERI as well as other similar studies, such as
conducted within the OECD, and more specifically from the perspective of neuroscience, we
demonstrated. According to these works and studies, it appears that "the science of learning
also emphasized the inverse relationship between age and learning
effective aspects of language: in general, the more one is exposed to a very early
second or third language and more likely it is to learn "
(EDU/CERI/CD.2008, 14). Therefore, introduce the use of the computer from the primary
is a commendable initiative which confirms the conclusions of this work.
Earlier the students take ownership of computers (the XO) better equipped they will be more
in these areas and will later develop expertise from classes
secondary level. They would improve once more reached the next level.
For example, Gabon has the potential to reduce the digital divide with the north.
Initiating early child to ICT and increasing opportunities for manipulation
XO handling through real learning situations in disciplines
varied, the learner is familiar with the tool and use it like any other medium
teaching (notebooks, books, slates, notebooks, etc.)..
So in order to facilitate the integration and use of the XO, with all its
affordances and potential in various contexts that chapter 2 presents the
different activities available, the affordances and potential educational applications
in different disciplines and levels of primary school and the procedures for using
these activities with the benefits of small green computer educational and
didactique.
Chapter 2
Introduction
This chapter presents the different activities of XO. They guide both the student and
teachers in various educational activities in the classroom and even
outside the school environment.
To this end, the XO contains a total of 28 activities. The question is what first
activity in this context? The activity is a well defined, for example, activity
Drawing, in which it carries out specified tasks. These activities were
thoughts for young learners (Bourdelais, 2008), ie "they are
used primarily in the school context "(idem). In other words, they are
also designed for students to work as a group, invite one or more
people connected in a network and join in the same activity. This is
Neighborhood where the perspective represented by a disc with eight points
keyboard whose accession is possible by its activation.
It will also focus on the classification of activities according to the curricula of Gabon. Then we
try to see if these activities of XO fit well with the approach by competencies
base (CPA) in effect at the primary school. Finally, building on the affordances of
activities, we will see how they can teach in such an approach.
To do this, we proceed with some educational applications.
Classification of activities
Of the 28 currently ongoing in the XO, the vast majority meet the
guidance curriculum of basic education as defined skills
french, mathematics and awakening. They are intended "to consolidate knowledge, skills and
knowledge being essential to education, education, and training of all citizens,
player development. "(IPN, June 2004), where the classification level and
curricula:

All activities from the 1st year
We note only that these activities have benefited from a gauge applications
teaching. But the XO also contains games (Maze), activities in English
(In Wikipedia, Help) and administration activities of the system (Terminal, Log,
Analyze). The fact remains that the teacher and students could use them if
there need a.
The XO activities with regard to the approach by competencies (APC)
The approach by competencies (APC) in force in Gabon since 2005 is a
integrative approach, ie it allows interaction between the student and his
environment. The PCA allows the student not to acquire a knowledge
juxtaposed, but to behave and the ability to resolve situations
problems in everyday life. In a socioconstructiviste, activities
CPA trying to make it operational in everyday life, the student has
mobilize the necessary tools for the resolution of problem situations in the context of
class. Thus, we must know whether the classified above can fit
with this approach to primary school.
To do this, we will present all activities that have been investigated
to identify the various affordances and some educational applications that we
can made with them.
Understanding the format for the activities

Activity Summary
A summary description of the activity and its various functions.
Affordances of the activity
According to Gibson (1979), we can define the capacity as an affordance suggestive
this action and apparent in the environment, ie that, by the way this
is designed, the affordance suggests possible actions to those who interact. It
further specifies that, for the user, the value of affordance should be reflected, therefore, be
emerging. It is therefore a partial list of affordances identified by our
community resource people.
Degree of centrality of the activity
<image 1-5 scale>
Once the appropriation of affordances of fact our community
contacts examined the integration of curriculum system
gabonais school. Thus, we evaluated on a scale numbered from 1 to 5 the degree of
centrality of the activity in question (1 designating a device or extracurricular activity and
5 designating a core activity to meet the curriculum objectives of the program).
Educational applications
The educational applications are illustrated suggestions for ways to use the
XO activities in the school of Gabon. In compliance with the curriculum, our
community resource people has developed two to three applications pédagogiques
for each activity.

is sent. Discussions can take place between two or more persons, the
minimum of people required for this activity is two. Messages sent during
a chat session are de facto available to all persons present
in the discussion. Sending messages is done spontaneously. This activity may
be used from the second year because it requires that the student can read and write.
This communication tool can support collaborative work as it can
allow the teacher to communicate with teachers in other classes.
Affordances of the activity
This activity would allow students of a certain class to communicate in writing with those of another class without them having to move.
Discuss the activity could be used by students to respond to a solicitation the teacher in the context of questions and answers.
It could in this context play a role and even replace the slate.
It could also promote interaction between students, but under the control of the teacher who could also interfere in the discussion.
The teacher could keep in touch with his class, even if the latter for some reason had to be away from his classroom.
It provides an opportunity for teachers to be able to converse with colleagues other class without having to travel.

This activity can be used as an interface for the resolution of application exercises.
It will allow the teacher to interact spontaneously and in real time with
students in its progression, but also in the process of appropriating
understanding and ownership of a course.
A teacher could use to realize the level of assimilation of
rules of conjugation of its pupils.
Thus, the teacher starts the Talk offers a verb, a time and a way which
the student must refer to perform the conjugation. Once the instructions given, each
students through its XO offers solutions to the teacher.
If students were offered to combine the verb to eat in the future indicative in the first
person singular, it should have read or at least I eat. But it may
instead of as I eat (future indicative) I eat there is (conditional
This) is not a right answer.
The teacher could then account for gaps and thus insist on a certain
number of elements in the progression of his courses, including opportunities
possible confusion with other times and insist on the pronunciation.

setting up of several teams. This application would lead to essentially
students to work together to make a translation job. Thus, the work will be divided
so that each student has a part of the work to be done so
individual, which individual will lead to a community so
that the different parties on an individual subject to the various students are
the subject of a community if we're to the analogy or metaphor of the
chain link and that is, the individual links will be here and the setting
common channel.
The teacher could use this application to translate a text in various
languages spoken in Gabon. Training teams to follow, therefore belonging to a
language group: the teams will be composed of members belonging to the same group
language and it will have as many groups and linguistic groups. The work will be
distributed within the various groups so that each member has a
part of the text to translate. The second part of the work will require the presence of all
group for the pooling of individual translations.

The teacher wrote the numbers on the blackboard, asks students to recognize the
keyboard, typing and press Enter. The XO refers to the sound from the figure that will be repeated by
students. For example, typing 0, they will hear "zero". This will enable them to
recognize by sight and hearing the numbers. Thus, students learn
easy to count and calculate. For the calculation, with the meaning of the signs that
return the XO, students can ensure that the transaction is that fact that he was
requested. This could help to overcome the errors of signs observed in
activities in mathematics.
Pedagogical application 3
Improvement of the lexical spelling.
Level (s)
: 1st year of primary
Knowledge

The teacher dictates a word, phrase or text. When the student finished, he types Enter.
The computer returns to the sounds of words. Take for example the word "consequence". If
forgot the accent on the "e", the XO will return to "consequence". At that time, students went
account of his error and bring the necessary correction. Similarly, students can learn
reading techniques respecting not only the punctuation, but also the diction of
words. This will facilitate the work of teachers and students in learning to read
of difficult words. If the student types such as "excess", the XO will give him the good
pronunciation of the word and keep it. It will be able to read words similar. Finally, given
that the XO is a pause after each punctuation mark, the student will not
only distinguish but also respect them during playback. For example,
Teacher asked to write the words "Mom goes to market she buys meat
vegetables and fruits and type Enter. The XO return the text block. Then the teacher
asked to put punctuation. "Mom goes to market. She buys meat,
vegetables and fruit. " The XO plays with sentence breaks and intonations.

involve the comparison of ensembles.
History
:
The teacher provides a scene where there are four circles representing four forest
within which there are animals.
Students should compare the forest and say what is that all animals that
another one with the fewer animals than the others, that more animals than the
others.
The master is expected that students compare sets by correspondence
animal by animal.
To carry out its educational applications, the teacher may:
Construct the scene on the XO;
The students sent to the grid;
Enable students to describe and comment on the scene;
Orally-ask the first question (identification of objects relative to a benchmark);
Allow students time to answer them individually;
Allow students time to share, to seek help;
How the whole class;
Repeat the same procedure for other questions.

Moon Activity
Activity Summary
The task of the learner would be to observe the object that appears on the screen of the activity
Moon of the XO. The learner has access to a wealth of information on the Moon, by
real time. Note that this activity can be used to better understand several concepts
related to the planet Earth. The learner can do activities on the image manipulation
in the XO as a metaphor for earth, and to make multiple uses. It may
use a grid with coordinates.
Through this activity, learners can learn and build an active
understanding of several concepts such as "of the spherical Earth," the location
from one point to the Earth's surface and the rotation of the Earth and its consequences
daily (including the succession of day and night). The activity has a strong Moon
capacity suggestive action that teachers can use in the course of Enlightenment.
This metaphor of the Earth is extremely relevant and original and could be
further substantiated in the educational applications outside of those we
propose here. Among other things, it allows the learner to observe phenomena that he
often described in abstract and theoretical and thus the testing of a
theoretical knowledge learned. It allows many other learning and
discoveries including scientific information about the behavior of the Moon. These
regularly updated information are clearly shown in the legend of
margin to the left of the metaphor.
Affordances of the activity
The student has access to real-time information on the Moon (phases, visibility the surface, the next lunar eclipse, the next solar eclipse)
The activity can also be used as course material in different ways "Earth" because it can be used to learning about the concept of "spherical of the earth. "
Students can also use this medium to a teaching on the learning "Locating a point on the surface of the Earth using the grid coordinates geography.
The student can change the face of the moon and then be led to understand the concept rotation of the Moon and Earth.
Social Affordances:
It could bring together learners each to his XO in case the neighborhood
grid would be impossible as we have just seen. In this case,
interactivity happen in the form of an exchange (driven by a possible
questionnaire) between learners using the XO as eBook.

of the activity will encourage it to start again until he wins. If the teacher
asks students to consider the activity as a problem to solve, depending on the level
of the learner and the game, they can say, for example, to subtract only the color
orange. The student who succeeds in doing so solved the problem. Otherwise, it
repeat the activity to obtain the desired result. The teacher can
transpose the effort during the game to solve problems in mathematics
for example.
NB: This application is not included in the curriculum. However, it has
educational benefits that teachers and students could take into account
all fields (and french enlightenment) to resolve the problems.

Conclusion
Ultimately, this chapter has attempted a description of the capabilities of XO in primary school 
Gabon. Far from being exhaustive, we accept that many activities can be exploited 
with the XO in school from primary school so unique. Similarly, it is 
possible to combine activities in the context of educational applications. 
Adapting to Gabon password, among other things, integration of XO in 
conformity with the curricula. To go further, we can still consider a 
Operating XO: pedagogy of the project.
Chapter 3
Introduction
This chapter suggests, by way of example, four projects that could be achieved by 
combining certain activities (or affordances) of the XO. These are projects on 
deforestation, disease, cultural heritage and national languages. As you 
see, these projects cover various fields of study. Each project is presented 
according to a style, because it seemed more important to reflect a certain 
variety of possible actions to unify the presentation of projects. However, each 
proposed project follows the methodology suggested by Gregory and Laferrière 
(1998):
<image Project path>
Project 1: The Herbarium at school
School project: "The herbarium at school. "
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project was designed to be completed in the fourth and / or fifth grade 
primary education system in Gabon.
FIRST PHASE: PREPARATION OF A DRAFT
Discussion of the feasibility of this project with two teachers, and Valentine Béranger, of 
Elementary School Application of the École Normale Supérieure. Both teachers 
found it very exciting and very timely especially as Valentine had already piloted a 
agriculture project with a third class of primary school. The "to the herbarium
school "seemed feasible.
1 / CHOOSE THE THEME:
The choice of the theme is left to the discretion of the teacher or the teacher, through 
a discussion with the target class, the great movement of logging in the city of
Libreville.
Learning Objectives:
Identify, photograph, name and recognition of certain plants in the environment closest to the student, here it is the courtyard of the school.
Identify some uses of plants.
Define the term "deforestation".
Identify some of the consequences of deforestation.
Raise awareness of the importance of plants in the environment of the student.
Planting trees in the school.
Develop a herbarium of 10 pages.
Skills and attitudes developed by students through the project:
Recognize, name awareness, planting trees, using the XO.
2 / TRACKING RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS:
Students will have access to resources in the library of the XO. They consult 
appropriate documents on the Internet, as well as software using the XO.
Obtaining the teacher of a student to leave school 
able to go to the National Herbarium in Libreville, and the herbarium of the University of 
Libreville.
3 / ORGANIZATION OF WORK:
The student must take ownership of the project, and the teacher play a role 
facilitator or resource person in the organization and execution of the project.
The teacher organizes the class into triads. Each triad is working on a plant. She 
photography plant using the XO, names using the information collected in the 
Bookstore XO, or exit at the National Herbarium and identifies some of the utilities 
plant. It makes this plant for a page and a page traditional electronic 
Herbarium.
Triads interchangent regularly each triad results and this in turn 
role its results to the class.
SECOND PHASE: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
The project may take the entire school year, one hour per week 
during the course of awakening. (It may take less time, about 6 months, if the teacher or 
the teacher decides to put the project to the time allotted to manual labor, 30
minutes per day in the Gabonese education system).
The teacher ensures that students respect the time and the interactions 
students help build a community of learners.
The teacher encourages frequent communication between learners, 
encourages, stimulates, corrects shooting, helping students to make regular updates on 
the development of their work.
4 / PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THOUGHT AND DOCUMENTS:
Progressive development within each triad, a thought of a living environment
for humans, the presence of plants, and its responsibility for its balance.
Progressive development, by any group class of a herbarium of plants from electronic 
School classified through the bookstore or log XO.
Progressive development, by any group class, a traditional plant, consisting of 10 
pages. Each page representing a plant by its leaves and / or dried flower, with its 
common name and scientific name, and some utilities to be its specificity.
Progressive development of a botanical garden, students will plant trees or 
few plants in the schoolyard.
5 / COORDINATION AND SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS:
Presentation to the whole class of tasks of each triad, questions and 
comments to enrich and enhance the collective production of the class.
The teacher spoke in front of the class to say what is positive 
compared to the project and improve deficiencies while encouraging and challenging.
THIRD PHASE: THE EXPLOITATION OF EDUCATIONAL PROJECT
6 / BACK ON THE PROJECT:
Once completed, the project should be allowed to teach the class group that 
Plants are essential to the human environment, as they provide oxygen, 
of food, shade etc ... Man must protect the plant from its environment 
and maintain such replanting.
7 / THE AFTERMATH OF THE PROJECT:
Development of a botanical garden, the primary school level. Students will plant 
some trees in the courtyard.
Exhibition of project results with other classes of the school and education 
other classes in respect of the environment including plants.
Sharing the results of the project with other schools in the city, rural or other 
countries through the Internet XO.
Project 2: Fight against unhealthy
The project will be implemented in three phases: design-implementation-evaluation.
Design
Note that to start the project includes all primary students, regardless of 
level. The difference will be simply at the level of involvement that can be 
associated with age, but the level of students.
The project may take place in three months from the school, which takes place in Gabon by 
me in October, ie in the first quarter. This schedule will have the advantage of seeing 
actions that can be achieved in the short medium and long term success.
The success of the project therefore involves the consideration of certain prior 
the teacher. In practice this means the teacher of 
around the question to identify a problem, so students should know 
what it is, identify information sources and the problem, then bring their 
reflections and proposals on possible solutions to this problem. 
In the case of the fight against unhealthy in Libreville, which is our example, we 
can make the following suggestions.
Define in simple terms and concepts appropriate to the statement taking into account the 
level of language study and students. Cleanliness, hygiene dirt would be in this 
optical concepts appropriate at all levels of primary education, ie the 
first to fourth year.
With the class, and from these definitions, a general view of the situation of the city 
Libreville identifying all sales areas without distinction. This concerns 
school in the neighborhood streets, etc..
To acquaint students with the origins and causes of this situation.
Awareness about the dangers of such a situation by referring to disease or even 
epidemics.
In practice this amounts to the unhealthy relationship between the city and work 
school. This will be to introduce students to the direct consequences of unhealthy 
academic performance. For example, show children that mosquitoes 
transmit malaria to humans, live not only in the high high 
grass around our schools and our homes, but also in wastewater ponds, 
gutters not priests populous neighborhoods of the capital of Gabon.
The project will then aim to make children aware of their rights and 
obligations to overcome this phenomenon. In this case, we will discuss ways 
human material and financial resources. The search, involving students in the design of 
this project through discussions in class to make them aware of 
problems in their environment and have a real impact on their lives. It 
is also to foster a spirit of civic involvement, foster cooperation, 
complementarity and solidarity.
Outturn
The executive phase of the project will be crucial to the extent it contains actions 
concrete that students faced in the field. These are the actions that materialize the 
child labor.
The teacher can organize such a tour of the class 
in a business of gathering and collecting garbage.
After this step, the integration of XO to the project is fundamental. It 
will use the little green computer as a tool for the class develops its thinking
on the fight against unhealthy in Libreville.
The activities of XO, such as compute, discuss distance, scratch, draw, write, navigate, 
video interview will be widely used to carry out the project, even 
if others can also be requested. It may for example rely on the 
Géraldine contribution to illustrate the contribution of XO in this struggle that will lead 
students. In addition, for example, the design can be made to the prospectus on 
good reflexes such do not throw garbage anywhere, and other shows where the cast. 
Contrary to the view Jean Paulin's remarks are very relevant, I 
support activities that calculate distance and fit perfectly to the project. As 
illustration, we will say that the context itself offers this opportunity:
Those who know Libreville realize that very often the garbage bins are prepared to enter schools and colleges, high schools, the smell of waste indispose regular students, the same is being done in neighborhoods with latrines that are built anarchic.
It can also be observed in Libreville that the bins are inadequate insofar as willing are often overwhelmed and fill an hour after the passage of Trucking, the company responsible for the collection and garbage disposal!
For this reason one can measure the distance of the bins with the school or latrines 
with houses, calculate the volume of the garbage bin, the amount of waste produced by a 
individual, and also the number of inhabitants in the district to understand why 
overflowing garbage bins and draw conclusions.
On the other hand, the actions may be to formulate requests for aid to 
NGOs to redo the paint for example. Similarly, 
Parents can contribute to repair toilets in schools that most 
Gabon institutions do not work or are to be built.
Assessment
From the knowledge gained from the project ask students to 
make proposals to remedy as far as possible the situation.
The information gathered will be used by the teacher in his 
teaching to the curriculum and materials of the class. In 
level of civic education, he or she can educate students about the behavior 
the management of individual waste to the extent that very often people throw 
garbage in prohibited places, sometimes we can see that some are on the ground 
even when there is a garbage bin or trash can next to it. Students are also 
champions of this attitude, since very little throw their garbage in the garbage.
The evaluation will be done by observing the behavior of students, changes 
occurring in their environment, and attention that will give them the authority 
Municipal and especially parents about the need to clean up their environment.
Project 3: The bars and I
Introduction
The education system is marked by the last few years of reforms aimed 
to make it more effective. The most significant realization of what we may agree 
to call a mini revolution is the introduction of a competency-based approach (SBA) 
primary school. This means going beyond the mere mastery of objectives by providing atomic 
students the opportunity to mobilize resources to deal with situations - problems 
complex.
In the following contribution, we propose an enrichment of the APC The approach (or 
pedagogy) project. The precursors of this approach are the Americans and Dewey 
Kilpatrick, Ukrainian Makarenko and french Freinet.
We see this as an educational framework for students to go 
even further in the mobilization of resources acquired in school. Indeed, 
working on projects that affect their daily lives, students can make 
the expertise developed in the classroom. The project approach offers, in 
Moreover, the possibility to collaborate with their peers and with other resource persons to 
through the tool. The use of a computer network is really the element 
most striking of a learning project. With the help and support from their teacher or 
their teacher, children will activate around a project which they assumed 
responsibility. They will be able to "learn together and develop a 
community of learners "(Laferrière, 2005) which can go well beyond their class, 
their city and their own countries.
How to operationalize the project pedagogy in the context if a particular 
gabonaise school?
The purpose of the discussion that follows is to outline an answer to this important issue. In 
Indeed, our schools are too often problems such as lack of equipment 
didactic or overstaffing. We show how the project approach 
can be implemented taking into account these peculiarities.
The example presented here is a project whose theme could be "the bars and I 'to
Students of a class of 5th grade. We will highlight the different 
steps for the realization of such a project: preparation, execution and 
exploitation pédagogique.
I - Project Preparation
Why this theme?
Pierre Monsard, academic gabonais died a few years ago, said not without 
reason that forty years of independence in Gabon, it was "constructed over pubs and 
bars and libraries. " This statement, knowing that anyone can Gabon 
reasonably challenging, well the problem of the proliferation of bars in 
our country. In the environment of the student, the bars are everywhere be it in the vicinity 
from home or near the school with their attendant nuisances. Among these disturbances on 
include the diurnal and nocturnal disturbance, alcoholism, smoking, etc..
In many families, the child is introduced very early in this universe. Indeed, it is not 
uncommon for young boys and girls of barely a decade are 
sent by their parents to buy beer or cigarettes at the nearest bar. And 
total violation of the law, the owners of these structures to sell alcohol and tobacco 
these minors. Thus, when a child buys a bottle of wine for example, there is no 
way to be sure it is not him - even eat.
No risk - so we not make alcoholics and smokers tomorrow?
The proliferation of bars in our cities is therefore to the fight against these scourges 
threaten our society.
Furthermore, bars are unique gabonais Walnut neighborhood in a real 
deluge of decibels at night and day. This course, once again, in contradiction 
with the Gabonese law prohibits noise. Sometimes the bars are so close to 
homes or schools, it is harder for children to work or simply 
to sleep because of the deafening sound of music. Thus, bars may 
negatively affect school performance.
It was just a few illustrations of the importance for students to reflect on the 
bars problem and propose possible solutions to minimize the effects 
negatively on their environment. However, experience shows that "for an approach 
project to succeed it must be close to his theme of life or centers of interest
students "(Munro).
Featured Resources
Science courses (as of alcohol and tobacco on health is on the agenda 5th grade);
Courses in mathematics (calculation of expenditures caused by alcohol and tobacco, Students may produce statements of problems on the basis of questions asked of those who attend bars and solve these problems by mobilizing resources acquired class issues recorded by the camera XO);
French course (Preparation of a brochure, posters, ...);
NGO (Action for Gabon or UNESCO, WHO, ...);
Collaboration with other schools in the same city, Gabon or outside of Gabon for such comparisons;
Geography and drawing (Making a map of the neighborhood bars and their proximity to school)
Measurement of sound intensity in the bars with the XO;
Organization
→ Action Plan:
Duration: 10 weeks, a half - day per week which does not seem excessive because of the high level of core activities;
Create groups of five students each with specific tasks;
Entertainment in bars under the supervision of the teacher or the teacher for interviews, videos, photos with the XO;
Invitation to an NGO to explain the social consequences (destruction of the cell family), a doctor to explain the impact of alcohol, tobacco and pollution sound man.
II - The project
Progressive development of thought and documents
As that project activities are carried out, students must take 
aware of the adverse effects on them - and on their environment 
the existence of so many bars. It is the emergence of individuals who 
alcohol, smoking and noise are problems that require social 
find a solution. Indeed, in what is going on, these scourges have too 
tend to be trivialized. The bars are there, they exist in our living environment without 
s'émeuve no effect if their destructive for our country. It is not uncommon to 
Libreville, for example, to meet a person lying on the floor or on the sidewalk 
on the road, intoxicated causing death as passers hilarity.
→ One or more production
This awareness must lead to the realization of actions aimed at reducing
adverse consequences in the life of students. This can be achieved by 
production of posters, leaflets, files, etc.. for their peers, to 
parents and the whole neighborhood. To fight against noise pollution for example, we can 
very well lead students to send a letter to the mayor of the commune in which 
located their neighborhood, to seek enforcement.
III - Educational Farms
Under this project, students were encouraged to make the contribution 
knowledge to solve a social problem that affects their lives. 
For example, competence in writing and speaking is put to 
to conduct interviews, prepare posters or leaflets.
From these interviews, children can collect data on expenditure 
daily to an individual bar. Then it may be useful to calculate the amount that 
individual spends monthly. This information can be used to produce 
statements of mathematical problems that will lead them to mobilize their knowledge in computing. 
Here, what is interesting is that the mathematical problem is not imposed on students, 
but it is them - themselves, from a social fact to them, go and ask the 
solve. The solution of the problem is simply an object of contemplation, but 
one more for the file and which will serve to convince.
Project 4: The national languages
Project Goal: Develop a glossary
Choose project:
The idea for a fact: the loss of national languages. Children speak up 
least in their languages. Hence the development of a glossary in order to practice 
local languages.
Resources:
Using the XO to save;
Adult speakers of each language listed;
The teacher as facilitator, coach learners to the development of glossary;
The activity will take place during the course of awakening, in 4th grade. The time spent for activity will depend on the organization of the teacher or the teacher.
Organization of work:
Identify the languages in the class to leave the groups in different languages;
Training groups. The groups will consist of speakers of the learners language. Those who find themselves alone integrate groups. The idea is that to learn another language, you should first speak their language;
Make a list of expressions and words in french, which will be contained in the glossary;
Collect data using the XO. Learners will record the voices of those resources and pronunciation of words and phrases will be maintained through the activity Memorize XO.
Coordination and synthesis of contributions:
Processing of data by class group. During this examination, the learners could share the different emotions that occurred during the harvest data with other groups through the activity of XO Talk;
Summary of groups and preparation of the glossary.
Note that this project will be for one quarter. The teacher's role would be to 
guide, guide learners suggestions, guidelines and attitudes to adopt 
for group work. Children will learn the polite phrases (hello, 
thank you, etc..), know the names of animals, trees, pets and will be encouraged to 
converse in local languages.
Continuation of the project:
Awareness campaign with games: For example, present an object (even photo) and ask other students to comment on the institution named in a local language. After the response, the group will bring the necessary correction, if need. Students could make a learning experience. Jurisdiction to develop, be able to translate a word or phrase local language.
New training group in class with people who did not work together (you can have two or three people from the same group) in the but to make them work in another language which is not necessarily theirs. The goal here is to encourage children to communicate in other langueslocales by exchanging other linguistic groups;
Development of another glossary.
Sharing a project in interaction with other institutions.
General Conclusion
Like many African countries, Gabon in recent years embarked on
a profound overhaul of its education system, through a revision of curricula 
in primary education generally (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th years).
To do this, the integration of ICT and particularly the XO to school gabonaise, under 
the international context and further prospects of UNESCO and OECD, which are aimed at 
development goals of the educational world, is a privilege granted to the activities of 
learner and teacher training and the teacher.
As such, this study guide refers to a dual purpose: the effective introduction of ICT 
including the XO in school gabonais and its feasibility, if not its 
relevance. To do this, the guidelines outlined in this guide are attempts 
authentic and on the applicability of this project is to reduce the crucible of 
digital divide. The XO is therefore as a teaching tool that gives 
the opportunity to learn not only to perform a specific task or solve 
problem situations effectively, but mostly it can not work 
only with other players in his immediate environment (through the network 
mesh), but apply via the Internet of people belonging to more distant universe.
According socioconstructiviste prospects, the changes in education are linked to a 
political objective is to increase the capacity of learners to
apply school knowledge to real world problems. In this 
perspective, this study guide has the ambition among others, to revisit the status of 
the teacher and the teacher. Indeed, now the teacher will become the 
guide and manager of the learning environment. Students are engaged 
in training activities or broad collaboration, cooperation and negotiation 
leitmotivs are allowing them to transcend the framework of the class and their 
provide the opportunity to engage effectively in the society of his time. 
This guide could then be used to support knowledge creation. Because the XO is a tool 
educational program which goes beyond the knowledge of school problems, it 
clearly includes the twenty-first century skills needed to create a new 
knowledge and engage in learning throughout life. 
After all, this guide is consistent with projects of international agencies 
educational leaders who put a singular emphasis on poverty reduction 
and improving the quality of life.
This guide is built into a triptych: technological literacy, deepening of knowledge and knowledge creation. Such 
are the terms that have contributed positively to the update of this study guide 
of XO.
