Actions
Cleanup the registry and bundles API mess.
(marco)
Merge content and activities. A bundle ought to be able to have *both* library.info *and* an activity.info.
(scott)
Use a content format which is consistent with "offline internet" content, more or less consider installing content files as pushing stuff into an offline cache.

Status
Marco did a little of refactoring as part of the more general shell work. Still very much of a mess.
