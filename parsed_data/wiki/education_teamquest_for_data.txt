--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page collects information from various stakeholders in the OLPC Sugar community to determine which statistical data are important to gather and how to analyze an visualize the data to in a meaningful way. These stakeholders are
learners
teachers
parents and guardians
principals and school administrators
deployment organizations
educational policymakers
sugar-core developers
sugar activity developers
researchers

Learning Analytics
We have identified the following stages in the learning analytics workflow. Implementation of each stage is independent to provide for flexibility of use by different stakeholders:
Measurement
Data is generated at the source
Journal metadata
sugar-stats
Collection
:
The measured data needs to be collected from the source, anonymized, aggregated, and prepared for processing.
transfer of data from schools to central location
anonymization: currently not implemented
olpc_journal_processor:
https://github.com/Leotis/olpc_journal_processor
xo-stats:
https://github.com/martasd/xo-stats
Analysis
Analysis of raw data or data aggregated in a database.
spreadsheet application (LibreOffice)
statistics application: SOFA Statistics, R, CouchDB views, etc.
Reporting
A meaningful report tailored to the needs of a particular audience is generated
CouchDB + D3.js, HighCharts, InfoVIS Toolkit, jqPlot, dc.js within Flask templates-> HTML, PNG, PS, PDF, SVG, etc.
Using CouchDB with InfoVIS Toolkit:

Sharing Results
Analysis results and visualizations are shared across deployments.
currently not implemented
Deployments
OLE Nepal
These are the basic questions answered in the first stage of
xo-stats
project.
Deployment Organizations:
How many times do installed activities get used? How does the activity use differ over time?
Which activities are children using to create files? What kind of files are being created?
Which activities are being launched in share-mode and how often?
Which part of the day do children play with the activities?
How does the set of activities used evolve as children age?
OLPC AU
The
Harvest
system is being used to gather some basic stats; A visualization tool will be developed to enable stakeholders (funders, administrators, and classroom teachers) to monitor these data.
OLPC Jamaica
The OLPC Dashboard project was developed at
The University of the West Indies, Jamaica
. It is an ongoing project. It consists of a two part system. The data collection script runs on the XS (or XSCE) school server. The script traverses the
/library/users/
directory on the XS school server and gathers the metadata from Sugar Journal backups. The collected metadata are then expressed as a comma-separated or CSV file. An alternative export method exports the data as json. The dashboard is where the analysis and reporting happen. The dashboard system is a selective visualization setup with a
CouchDB
backend. The json is pushed into a CouchDB database on the XS. Then, selective data aggregates are produced via views in CouchDB and displayed using a JavaScript front end. This step happens on the local XS (views for teacher and principal). However, an aggregated view can happen centrally as well. The CouchDB on the XS can also be synchronized with a central CouchDB, where the visualization may be different, perhaps for personnel at the country's Ministry of Education. Code and test data can be found at
olpc_journal_processor
and
olpc-datavisualization
