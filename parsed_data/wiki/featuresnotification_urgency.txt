Current status
Targeted release: 0.104
Last updated: 10/Aug/2014
Percentage of completion: 50% - needs discussion
Benefit to Sugar
The ability to have silent notifications - e.g.: auto activity update notifications
Compatibility with the rest of the Linux desktop world
Scope
It is a small change that does not break compatibility.
UI Design
Normal notifications remain unchanged
Low priority notifications get no flashy icon popup corner thing - but they still get a place in the frame
Critical notifications get a flashy corner thing like this:
How To Test
Run and change this in Pippy:
import dbus
BUS_NAME = 'org.freedesktop.Notifications'
OBJ_PATH = '/org/freedesktop/Notifications'
IFACE_NAME = 'org.freedesktop.Notifications'
bus = dbus.SessionBus()
notify_obj = bus.get_object(BUS_NAME,OBJ_PATH)
notifications = dbus.Interface(notify_obj,IFACE_NAME)

# 0=low, 1=normal, 2=critical
# CHANGE ME!!!
urgency = 1

notifications.Notify("Software Update", 0, "", "New activities are available!", "Please check your activities list", [], {'x-sugar-icon-name': 'module-updater', 'urgency': urgency}, -1)
Dependencies
None!
