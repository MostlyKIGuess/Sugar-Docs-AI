--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Networks may link Sugar users to each other in order to chat, interact and collaborate.  Many Sugar activities have automatic collaboration and chat features.
For Sugar users on a local network, the linking is automatic, using Link-local XMPP connection management via the Telepathy Salut software.  Each Sugar user will be shown on the
Neighbourhood View
.
For Sugar users distributed over a wide area network, linking can be through an XMPP or
Jabber
server.  A server is operated by Sugar Labs for testing, and some schools or teams may run their own server.
Talk to your network administrator for the best Jabber server to use.  See
My Settings, Network, Server
