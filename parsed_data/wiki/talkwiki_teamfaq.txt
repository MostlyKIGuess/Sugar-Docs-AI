Reporting wiki problems
I note you have broken links on some wiki pages. Can you have a link on the page to report them as we do on all our pages on www.bible.org? (When someone clicks on the feedback/trouble link, we make a new ticket and capture the page they were on so we can see what they are talking about.)
Our wiki software does not as easily support this style of feedback.  We allow direct editing of most pages, so anyone noticing an error can correct it directly, or leave a recommendation on the Talk/Discussion page associated with the problem page.  --
