Object Halos
Right-clicking on any object in Squeak or Etoys brings up a halo of tool icons, as in this image. Etoys provides an interactive tutorial on Halo tools in the form of a game called the Demon Castle.
Starting at the top left and proceeding counterclockwise, the icons for a Workspace window are
X, Remove from screen
O, Collapse
Eye, Open a viewer for me.
Rectangle, Make a tile representing this object
Whirly square, Rotate
Title
Box and partial frame, Change size
Eye dropper, Change color
Wrench, Debug
Two rectangles, Duplicate
Square with corners, Move
Square with tongs, Pick up
Menu, as shown below
Most of these are reasonably discoverable. The
object viewer
requires further explanation.
Different kinds of object may have a different selection of tools in the halo. For example, the halo on a text object includes tools for selecting fonts and applying styles to portions of the text.
