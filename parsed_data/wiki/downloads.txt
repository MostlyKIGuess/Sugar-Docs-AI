Are you new to Sugar?
There are two Live Systems that run Sugar from a USB stick or bootable DVD:
Sugar on a Stick
based on Fedora, runs on 64-bit PCs and OS/X Macintoshes, OLPC XO and Raspberry Pi, in English only
Trisquel On A Sugar Toast
, runs on 32- and 64-bit PCs and has more Activities and world language support
If you have a high-speed Internet connection,
Fedora with the Sugar graphical learning environment
may be installed to a hard disk or a a 4 GB USB stick with a
Netinstall CD
Do you use GNU/Linux?
Sugar is supported by several GNU/Linux distributions.  Sugar Labs does not support any specific distribution, but does focus development on Fedora and Debian, which helps SoaS and Ubuntu.
