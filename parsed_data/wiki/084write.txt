What is new for users
New Color Picker
The Text Toolbar has been changed to make use of the new ColorToolButton widget introduced by Benjamin Berg.
The Object Chooser can now be filtered by data type. The dialog opened by the import image functionality in the Image toolbar will now only display Journal entries that are images.
