Getting set up on IRC
Copied from
Google_Code_In_2018/background#Getting_set_up_on_IRC
We use IRC for much of our communication. Unfortunate, Freenode, our IRC server, has been under attack by trolls of late, so we have had to lock down our channels. Therefore, you'll need to create a "registered account" to login. (You can use an IRC client or open
https://webchat.freenode.net
in a browser.)
To register on Freenode:
/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
(Filling in your email and password)
Leave the window open if possible.
You will get an email that includes a command you'll need to type in to complete your registration. (It may take a while for the email to arrive.)
Go back to the open IRC window and paste in the verification line from the email you received in the bottom space.
If you have closed the IRC window, you will need to reopen it.
Once you are registered, you may join the #sugar channel:
/join #sugar
When you reconnect at a later date, you may have to:
/msg NickServ identify your-password
Please contact walter @ sugarlabs . org if you have any questions.
logon to soas irc app
use another irc app (Hexchat) in workstation or Mate (see links below) to register your nickname
in mate or workstation terminal "dnf groupinstall sugar-desktop-environment"  log into sugar at login
#Fedora for (Autojoin Channels)
use "set irc_connect_delay 15" for (connect commands) in Hexchat
/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
look at e-mail in workstation or mate desktop and reply
start soas irc as registered user
/join #pidora    (pidora allows commands and name ((nick)) changes)
/msg nickserv identify (your primary nick) (password)
change nick to (your primary nick)
/join #sugar
You should be allowed to talk

tested Beta:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/29/Spins
"Greetings. Per this fesco ticket:
https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1714
I have created the Fedora 28 spins/labs page:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/28/Spins
All spin maintainers/owners/interested parties should test their spins and at least update this wiki page with beta/final testing. Spins that don't have at least one tester at Beta may be dropped and not shipped in Final, so PLEASE make sure at least someone tests. Spin maintainers are also encouraged to test their spin more often and make sure it's composing correctly every day for Branched f28 and rawhide. Thanks, kevin."

How to Clear ./sugar
When making a new VM
, to clear the Sugar Journal of old entries and to avoid identity conflicts among copies of the VM, enter the command
rm -rf ~/.sugar
in the Terminal activity. Then shutdown the VM. This will clear all Learner information on the VM and let you start with a fresh install. Skipping this will result in collisions in the Neighborhood view of the Jabber network between separate copies of the appliance. Verify the presence of the
.sugar
directory by entering
ls -a
in Terminal.
When cloning a customized VM
, in order to keep the Journal and installed .xo Activities, use
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
in the Sugar Terminal, and then
shutdown the VM
. enter in root terminal:
su (password) shutdown -h now
This leaves the Journal entries and removes only the previous Learner's identity key files.
To clear the Sugar Journal
:
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/datastore
This may be needed if the Journal becomes clogged with too many entries.
USE WITH CAUTION'
