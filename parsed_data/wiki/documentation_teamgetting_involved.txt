The weakest link in many open source software projects is documentation.  Writing effective documentation is hard.  Rather than attempting to start from scratch creating our own documentation team, Sugar Labs has chosen to work with with
FLOSS manuals
to create the Sugar user documentation.
In many Open Source Software Projects, writers struggle valiantly in an environment that is designed to produce code not prose.  FLOSS Manuals is a community of writers who create documentation for Free and Open Source Projects. Acknowledging that fact, we encourage interested  contributors to become involved in the FLOSS Manual
community
rather then contribute directly to Sugar Labs user documentation.
Their excellent getting started guide is at
OLPC simple
.
Works in progress are listed in the Documentation Team/KnowledgeBase .
