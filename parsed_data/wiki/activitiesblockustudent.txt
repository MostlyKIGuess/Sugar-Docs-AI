Student Feedback
From a 4th grade class in Allendale Columbia School:
It is easy to understand with clear instructions.
Itâ€™s a hard game but was fun.
The game should have settings to change the level of difficulty before game begins instead of standard forced game.
Some kids requested easier levels.
Hard but not too hard.
Side calculator to help those in need
"The game was fun, it was good because it had to do with math and adding things to get to a number. It was hard but not too hard. I need to reuse my instructions"
