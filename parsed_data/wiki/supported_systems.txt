Ways to run Sugar
Determine which of the various methods of running Sugar meet your needs:
Run Sugar pre-installed in a computer
Some computers come with Sugar pre-installed, most notably the
OLPC XO laptops
.
Some deployments use the
Dextrose
distribution of Sugar.
Boot a Live CD / Live USB pre-installed with Sugar
Suitable for trying Sugar without having to install any software on almost any computer—just boot Sugar off of a CD or USB drive.
Note:
When booting a Live CD, the Journal is not automatically saved on shutdown, because the boot media is readonly. All changes are lost upon shutdown or reboot. This is not a limitation for Live USB installations.  See our
Sugar on a Stick
project page or other
Live USB projects
.
Install Sugar
If you are running one of the currently supported distributions, you can install Sugar using your systems standard package manager, e.g., Synaptic, apt-get, or yum. See
these instructions
.
The
Harmonic Distribution
of the Sugar Learning Platform may also appeal to you.
Install an emulator or virtualizer and launch a bootable Sugar disk image file
QEMU
,
VirtualBox
, or
VMware
let you run Sugar in an emulator or by virtualization on your computer—you'll need to install an emulator from which you launch Sugar and one of the
Emulator image files
.
Supported distributions
Sugar is supported by several GNU/Linux distributions.  Sugar Labs does not support any specific distribution, but does focus development on Fedora and Debian, which helps SoaS and Ubuntu.
