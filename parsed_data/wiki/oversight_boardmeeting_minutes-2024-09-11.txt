GSoC and DMP report
Lionel is merging the 3D volume activity. There are some missing tasks on the VueJS project due to an issue on Android.
Both students will continue their works after GSoC.
Ibiam has helped Ajeet with the collaboration server deployment (for MB). It should be available for testing in short order
The RPi team is wrapping up. Still some build issues that will get worked through post-DMP/GSoC
The Math Games guys have some really nice additions. They'll be migrating the best to flatpak
MIDI import and ABC import are merged
Martín Abente Lahaye: any updates re flatpak?
The MB lesson-plans project is complete and very cool. We need to discuss model hosting (later on the agenda).
We're already receiving interest for the following year, and need to discuss ways to support interested students.
Devin is collecting feedback from this year's students, which I will share at the next meeting.
GSoC and DMP mentors are being asked to meet for a reflections meeting. The poll for finding a meeting time is [here](here:
https://framadate.org/xgn5bPtVuPKcmjOW
).
Thursday, 9/26/24 at 9am EDT seems to be the only agreeable time thus far for a mentor feedback session.
Election discussion
Devin did some research on different software we can use, and is down to two he thinks would be worth trying: [Election software research](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yd6rLfd7SrrHAPVQnLPpJUr01LBHe_sI6HdcGl0vW_I/edit?usp=sharing
)
Devin would like to look into [Star Vote](
https://star.vote/
) and and [Elekto](
https://elekto.dev/
)
We need an elections commissioner to work together with the ED and the board to do the following:
Create a timeline for the election
Document eligibility requirements
Call for candidates
Publish position papers
Create communication and outreach (get out the vote) strategy
Review software, run preliminary tests
Run election
Announce results
Review the process and make recommendations for future improvements
Attend weekly update meetings for approximately two months to accomplish the following
If anyone from the community sees this and is interested to assist, please feel free to ping Devin.
Board member attendance and meeting times
Devin put [this spreadsheet](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eE2mc6t2XcmZtD-_wfeYw6zluqRT5yU9B6nwIAB2YL0/edit?usp=sharing
) together to help show where we're at with board attendance to meetings.
GSoC resources
Ibiam is helping to set up the collab server. presumably the same mechanism can be used for some AI model support. (We were thinking of using a cloud provider as we need GPU support, Devin reached out to coreweave to see if we can use their service as it seems they're cheaper than AWS. But in the short term we can forgo GPUs: Ibiam can repurpose one vm and we could run an API there;
Install all the dependencies they need and have them use that.)
Devin pinged AWS about our open source credits, but hasn't heard back yet.
Fedora packaging
Ibiam has rebuilt all the packages in a side tag and opened a freeze exception ticket.
The builds are yet to be merged.
