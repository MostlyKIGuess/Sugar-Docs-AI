--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a imminently graduating RIT student in Computer Science.  I have a good background in Linux and Python, and strongly support efforts to improve education worldwide.
My development interests for the
RIT
project and in general include:
Networking and backend support features
Python support libraries and tutorial or cookbook-like documentation
Musical composition and synthesis
Interaction with the physical environment (sensors, measurement tools, input devices, etc.)
I am hoping to find some people to work with who are more focused on front-end / UI / interaction design so we can complement each other's strengths and preferences. (I'm not very visual, and very textual / verbal, which is in direct conflict with the Sugar design principles for language independence.)
Math4 Learning Objectives
I would be interested in helping to develop Activities focusing on the Patterns, Relations, and Algebra topics in the
fourth grade math learning objectives
. In particular, I would like to be involved in an effort to make appropriate use of mathematical notation in Activities (in general, as well as for the Math4 goals).
