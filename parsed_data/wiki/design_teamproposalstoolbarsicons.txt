Icons
Place to share and review proposed toolbar icons.
Customize
Many Activities allow the learner to make customized versions, e.g., make your own memory game in Memorize or make your own abacus in Abacus. It would be nice to have a standardized toolbar icon for this feature. The 'view source' icon (shown inverted here) seems ideally suited.
Yes, but its dual role (one for view source and the other for edit) can be confusing, unless we provide some indication of the particular role.  Perhaps, a ghost (white) background gear behind the image when it signifies editing.  --
