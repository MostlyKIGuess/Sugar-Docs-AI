Sucrose 0.89.3 Release Notes
Announcement
This is our third release in the
0.90 development cycle
!
We now reached Feature Freeze! We are glad to announce that two Features have been pushed already.
A
new color selector
is available for the control panel, thanks to the ongoing efforts of Walter Bender and the design team. We already wanted to land the Feature in 0.88 but had so many ideas that we did not reach consensus in the end. Now, we are excited to hear what the learners think about it.
To mimic the mesh behavior on devices where mesh hardware is not available and make the "under a tree"-scenario possible the Sugar Ad-hoc networks have been added.
The Feature
will add three default Ad-hoc networks, for channel 1, 6 and 11. They will be represented with designated icons in the neighborhood view. If Sugar sees no "known" network (the learner has not been connected to an currently available Access Point before) when it starts, it does autoconnect to an Ad-hoc network. First we try if there is an Ad-hoc network that is used by other learners in the area, if not we default to channel 1.
Another great Feature will be available in 0.89.4.
This Feature
removes the need for the Presence Service, meaning that activities and the Shell need to interact directly with non-Sugar-specific services such as Telepathy. As it touches three modules reviewing took a few more days. Since it is the mayor 0.90 Feature we gave it a deadline exception. The code has been pushed as I am writing these lines...
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
There are no known compatibility issues, as of today.
