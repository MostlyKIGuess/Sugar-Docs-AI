Policies
Create documented process for requesting sysop priv, for now model on
OLPC:Administrators
Administrative privs are generally granted based on a need to use them to do "something good" for the wiki.  At present, this is accomplished in a fairly informal manner, leaving a message on the
discussion
page or contacting one or more bureaucrats via wiki-mail would be a good place to start.
Further Reading
The best way to get involved in the wiki team is to monitor new content as it is added through the Recent Changes link in the Sugar Labs menu.  Check to see:
Is the new information correct?
Is the new information in the correct place?
Should the new information be merged with an existing page?
Wiki Infrastructure
Service/wiki
Wiki-barnraising, harmonization of familiar and useful templates, plug-ins, extensions (e.g. traclink,etc.) from OLPC wiki.
It would be good to get some countervandalism software (bot) running.
User:Cjl
has done some analysis of the vandalism (and countervandalism) actions on wiki.l.o and is interested in
coordinating an effort
that would cover both wikis with some automated countervandalism tools
Pages under construction
To aid collaborators, please use the
Template:Under construction
