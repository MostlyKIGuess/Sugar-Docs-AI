I contributed to openSUSE's
popcorn
project during GSoC 2012. Popcorn collects anonymous data about usage of RPM packages. I implemented various features including making data collection anonymous, packaging client RPM, implement a simple RESTful API, integration of client in settings user interface (YaST). Source code is available on
github
. My contributions are under username
axitkhurana
.
Also, working towards a small patch for TOR's stem library.
About my Project
Project description
What is the name of your project? Describe your project in 10-20 sentences. What are you making? Who are you making it for, and why do they need it? What technologies (programming languages, etc.) will you be using?
Project sharing website
will allow kids to share their projects they have created using various Sugar activities like Paint, Tam Tam or Turtle Art.
This website will be designed for kids where they can showcase their projects, learning from and using others projects, creating a fun, collaborative environment. Teachers will be able to use virtual classrooms and uploaded projects to teach kids to draw, program or create music. Parents will be able to see and appreciate their kids' creations by commenting on their projects. For activity developers they could show what their activities can do and how to do them in Teacher's view.
On the frontend, I'll be using
Twitter Bootstrap
, a front-end development framework, and
JQuery
On the backend,  the application will use Python and
Django
as the web framework to develop the application faster.

My Backround
Convince us, in 5-15 sentences, that you will be able to successfully complete your project in the timeline you have described. This is usually where people describe their past experiences, credentials, prior projects, schoolwork, and that sort of thing, but be creative. Link to prior work or other resources as relevant.
Iâ€™m studying Computer Science, 4th year at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I have a decent amount of experience in web development in Python and Web Frameworks like Django and Flask.
My contribution to openSUSE's
popcorn
project during GSoC 2012, involved development in Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy with attention to PEP 8 compliant code. We used Travis CI for continuous integration and Git for version control and collaboration.
I am a part of Information Management Group, in IIT Roorkee, which is a student body responsible for developing and managing all Internet and Intranet applications in IIT Roorkee, including the
institute website
and
registration & placement portals
. One of the projects I have worked at IMG is Softwares application. It's available on the intranet but Mid development demo is hosted on
heroku
I have contributed to Entrepreneurship Development Cell, IIT Roorkee's Django based
website
in 2011-12 which is hosted on Amazon EC2 Cloud. The code is available on
Github
and the website was featured on
Django website showcase
SnapApp
was a hobby project, I worked on for playing with Facebook API and Django's manage.py custom commands. It creates albums from photos from your Facebook account.
Me and the Community
Impact on the Sugar Labs community
If your project is successfully completed, what will its impact be on the Sugar Labs community? Give 3 answers, each 1-3 paragraphs in length. The first one should be yours. The other two should be answers from members of the Sugar Labs community, at least one of whom should be a Sugar Labs GSoC mentor. Provide email contact information for non-GSoC mentors.
Kids will be able to show their creations to the world. They'll also learn more by working on each other's projects. Teachers and Activity developers can work on creating tutorials for projects. Parents will be able to see what their kids have been learning and appreciate their projects there.
The key is learning from each other. By sharing projects, we can share best practice, learn from each other's mistakes and successes, and in general, engage in a critical dialogue. --

Sugar pilot deployment
Sugar Labs will be working to set up a small (5-30 unit) Sugar pilot near each student project that is accepted to GSoC so that you can immediately see how your work affects children in a deployment. We will make arrangements to either supply or find all the equipment needed. Do you have any ideas on where you would like your deployment to be, who you would like to be involved, and how we can help you and the community in your area begin it?
It would be great if we could set up a pilot deployment at
Anushruti
, which is the first school for the deaf in India in an Hi-Tech Institute of National Importance. It is situated inside my college, IIT Roorkee, and I can help with setting up by coordinating with Sugar and the school, as our student group, Information Management Group, helped with their website design. Sugar's clean collaborative platform would really improve the learning environment there.
What will you do if you get stuck on your project and your mentor isn't around?
Try to solve the problem myself. If I am unable to  and if it isn't urgent, I'll send an email and work on something else. If it is I'll try to get help from other people in the community on IRC or mailing list.
Keeping the community informed about problems and questions
How do you propose you will be keeping the community informed of your progress and any problems or questions you might have over the course of the project?
Blogging and posting weekly progress on the group with any problems.
Miscellaneous
Screenshot of my Sugar development environment
We want to make sure that you can set up a development environment before the summer starts. Please send us a link to a screenshot of your Sugar development environment with the following modification: when you hover over the XO-person icon in the middle of Home view, the drop-down text should have your email in place of "Restart." See the image on the right for an example. It's normal to need assistance with this, so please visit our IRC channel, #sugar on irc.freenode.net, and ask for help.
What is your t-shirt size?
(Yes, we know Google asks for this already; humor us.)
Large (L)
Describe a great learning experience you had as a child.
It was Christmas time and my mom got me this gift with Santa in a water filled glass cover with sparkling glitter. I kept in the freezer, I don't remember why, but the next morning, I found that it was broken. It was sad, but I learned water expands on freezing instead of contracting. Years later studied the hydrogen bonded crystalline structure in 11th class as well.
Additional information
Is there anything else we should have asked you or anything else that we should know that might make us like you or your project more?
