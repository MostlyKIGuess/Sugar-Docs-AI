x2x
is an utility to share the Keyboard and Mouse between more than one computer. So you can configure your Desktop PC with its regular Keyboard and Mouse to write and move the pointer cursor on the XO. This is very useful to me, so I'm going to explain here what I did (on Fedora 17) to set it up.
Download the source
git clone
git://github.com/dottedmag/x2x.git
Install required dependencies to build it
sudo yum install libXtst-devel.x86_64
Configure and compile it
cd x2x
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
Go to the XO and connect to your Desktop PC via SSH and run x2x
ssh -X yourusername@yourdesktophostname / yourdesktopip
cd x2x
DISPLAY=:0 ./x2x -to `echo $DISPLAY` -west
Now you can move the mouse up to the left side of the screen and if you keep moving it in that direction the cursor will appear in the XO screen. Once you have focus on the XO when you type on the Desktop Keyboard you will be typing in the XO. It's magic!
Even more, you can
share
the clipboard between the PCsÂ :)
NOTE: I used
-west
because I have my XO at the left of my Desktop PC
