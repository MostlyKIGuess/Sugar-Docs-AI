How to use IRC channels
IRC,
Internet Relay Chat
Sugar Labs no longer uses IRC as the primary mode of communication.
Matrix
is the preferred mode of communication. Nevertheless, the matrix and IRC channels are bridged using
Matrix Appservice IRC
. IRC channel only exists for backward compatibility.
The
IRC activity
allows access to IRC from within the Sugar environment.
You can use a computer-based client to log in to IRC, such as
Pidgin
or
X-Chat
. This link should work for such clients:
irc://irc.libera.chat#sugar
Or, use a browser add-on, such as
CIRC
(for Chrome). Current versions of Firefox are no longer compatible with add-ons, so ChatZilla will only work if you are using a sufficiently older version of Firefox.
IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion 'channels', but allows for personal chat and data transfer as well.
Sugar Labs is moving sugar channels from Freenode.net to Libera.chat.
The Sugar Labs Community uses a series of
channels
in the
irc.libera.chat
network.

How to use IRC channels
A web-based chat for other channels is
Mibbit
, with nickname: (whatever you like), server: irc.oftc.net, and channel: #schoolserver (or whatever other channel you're trying to get into). It also includes an in-line
translation
service that is helpful when other languages are used.
Some helpful resources are

, and
this tutorial
, which also includes basic commands.

For IRC under sugar, install the latest
Sugar IRC activity
.
In Pidgin you can configure IRC and then Add a Chat to your Buddy list. Select the IRC channel from the drop-down menu, and enter the name of the channel. You can set Pidgin to open channels automatically whenever it starts up.
In a traditional IRC client, you join a channel with the /join command, for example, enter
/join #sugar
in the input box.
Connect to one of the above channels, and say hello. You will see a list of the handles (on-line names) of the people in the channel, and the conversation will appear in a scrolling window. Type your message in the command entry area, and press return.
