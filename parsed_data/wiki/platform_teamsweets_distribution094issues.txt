Nickname clash breaks jabber DBus tubes collaboration
It sounds like if sugar users have the same nickname, it breaks DBus tubes collaboration.
How to reproduce:
box
A
needs to be connected to jabber.sugarlabs.org;
share Browse instance on
A
box;
bookmark one of pages;
join it from the
B
box;
in joined activity on
B
box, the bookmark is not shown.
The same scenario works fine if both boxes connected via Salut (when jabber is not accessible).
This issue requires investigation.
