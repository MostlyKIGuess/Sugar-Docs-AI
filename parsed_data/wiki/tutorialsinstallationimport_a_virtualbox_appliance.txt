This tutorial will show how to import an appliance into VirtualBox.

VirtualBox appliances
that you can download and import.
This is a simple way to run various versions of Sugar on your PC or Mac.

is OS agnostic and runs the same appliance in Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac operating systems. It must be installed on your system first.
