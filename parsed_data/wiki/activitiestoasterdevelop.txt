Please contribute to this collection. These are the resources we used in learning to develop our Activity
SOAS & Builds
http://spins.fedoraproject.org/soas/
- Sugar on a Stick (SOAS) is now an official Fedora Spin.  This means Fedora 13 and beyond provide the newest versions of Sugar, however deployments of XOs are often using F11 or F9 based builds.  Toaster is targeting full support for F11 and F9.
For Ubuntu machines until the
Ubuntu Sugarteam
make more progress the best advice is to run Sugar in a window with Virtualbox & Fedora or dual booting.
Key References
Reading python code of activities in any Sugar environment, on an
XO
, using
Sugar on a Stick
or using the above virtualbox environment will be helpful in learning how to create our own.

Python docs are quite good as references and for
tutorials
.
I found a
video series
that led me to this video of
Nicholas Negroponte from TED
XO 1.5 Specific
Disassembly
and some electrical tape is required to
prevent damage
to the wifi cards of the XO 1.5 we received.

To get white on black terminal edit ~/.sugar/default/terminalrc and swap #000000 and #ffffff
sudo yum install vim-enhanced gives a more feature rich vim editor
sudo vi /etc/fstab ; change the /var/tmp size= to 20%.  This is used by yum in some circumstances instead of /var/cache/yum
sudo vi /etc/rc.d/rc.local ; add "mkdir --mode 777 /var/run/screen" required by screen

ToDo
file a bug advertising the Activity is
ready for translation
using Pootle, then make sure to run ./setup.py genpot every time a new string is added and ./setup.py fix_manifest to keep MANIFEST up to date, especially before a release.
git tag -m "Release 1" v1 HEAD ; git push --tags
