--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Android penetration into the consumer market is vastly greater than the GNU/Linux desktop (or perhaps even Windows). Since our goal is to provide great learning tools to children, irrespective of the technology made available to them, how can Sugar Labs take advantage of the proliferation of Android devices?
Task
Analyze what it would entail to port Sugar to Android.
