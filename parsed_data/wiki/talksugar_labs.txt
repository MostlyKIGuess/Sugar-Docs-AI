Page refresh
This page seems outdated now that we have the Community sidebar.  Its at the top of the Community group, let's refresh it. --

Yes. This page is very much out of date. --

I came to this page looking for a mission statement and was disappointed, probably because its hard for a community based, loosely connected group, to arrive at one by concensus. I took the liberty of importing 5 dot points under mission, hopt that's ok --

I lost track of this page after the reorganization of the wiki. Is there not a mission statement of sorts on the static site? --

explore, express, debug, critique
is a great set of four goals.
The four goals currently listed on this page are different -- indeed, they have almost no overlap.  They are improving the simplicity of
sharing activities
installing activities
writing new activities,
being secure while using activities
This is compatible with a constellation of lightly-connected developers creating appliance-style activities, each a microcosm of its own, and passing them on to users who are expected to share them as is (or send patches to their owners).
It doesn't explicitly aim to support exploring (through active, permeating view-and-modify-source interfaces suitable for all learners), debugging (ditto, along with active debugger, logging, and visualization interfaces suitable for all learners), or critiquing (through any sort of shareable annotation or commentary).
I hope this is a matter of "
what comes first, and what comes second
" and not a shift in goals for Sugar as a meme and environment.

I propose adding the fedora-olpc weekly meeting to the SL calendar as it touches some sugar-related issues. It's every thursday at 18.00 UTC.

broken links
The recent change from referencing the calendar images directly to using wiki words breaks the use of those images as links. Was that intentional? --

Only partly. My failure to test completely. Sorry. They have been updated.  --

use of (r)
Not sure we need to use it more than at the bottom of the page, although it is not a bad idea to use it the first time Sugar Labs is used on the site as well. --
