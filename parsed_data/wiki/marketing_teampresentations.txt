Presentations on Logo Like Languages
The visual programming languages
Turtle Art
, Scratch and
Etoys
can be described as "Logo like" in that they are accessable to young kids, are used to promote problem solving and can produce geometric pen trails from programmable turtles (or cats or cars). They are superior to Logo in that they are visual languages rather than text based which allows kids to spend their time in higher order problem solving rather than syntax. Following are presentations which support the educational use of Logo like or visual programming languages.
