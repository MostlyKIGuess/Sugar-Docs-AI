Testing plans
Mesh network
Flash at least two XOs with the latest version of Sugar and the latest version of NetworkManager.
Autoconnect
connect to an Access Point on one machine and restart the machine
->
the machine does autoconnect with the AP
start the machine without having connected to an AP before
->
the machine should autoconnect to a mesh network
Connect both machines to the same channel
->
the buddies should be present on the neighborhood view of the other machine
Share an activity
->
the shared activity is displayed correctly in the neighborhod view and the sharing does work
Ad-hoc network
Flash at least two XOs with the latest version of Sugar and the latest version of NetworkManager.
Autoconnect
connect to an Access Point on one machine and restart the machine
--->
the machine does autoconnect with the AP
start the machine without having connected to an AP before
--->
the machine should autoconnect to Ad-hoc network 1
start machine A and connect to the Ad-hoc network 6, start machine B without having been connected to an AP before
--->
machine B should autoconnect to the Ad-hoc network 6
Connect both machines to the same channel
--->
the buddies should be present on the neighborhood view of the other machine
Share an activity
--->
the shared activity is displayed correctly in the neighborhod view and the sharing does work
Population
The Ad-hoc icons in the neighborhood view do indicate whether the network is "populated" or not, whether it is used by more than one person. It does not indicate the number of people that are connected though. If the fill color of the Ad-hoc icon is set then there is at least one person listening.
On machine A connect to an Ad-hoc network. Start machine B which has been connected to an access point before.
--->
On machine B it should automatically connect to the access point and the icon representing the Ad-hoc network machine A is connected to should be colored, the fill color is set.
Shut down machine A.
--->
after 10-15 minutes the icon representing the Ad-hoc network machine A is connected to should be uncolored, the fill color is NOT set. This is indicates that the network is not populated.
Collaborate between XO-1.0 and XO-1.5 without infrastructure
The XO-1.5 and XO-1.0 will see adhoc networks in his neighborhood view, so it the XO-1.0 can connect to an adhoc network that has been created by a learner on the XO-1.5.
