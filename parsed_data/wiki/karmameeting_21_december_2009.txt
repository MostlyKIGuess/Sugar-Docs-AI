Agenda
Coding Style
when in doubt, use camelCase
  constants in all CAPS, w/ _ separating multiple words --> COUNT_ERRORS = 10;
  boolean variables should be prefixed w/ "is" "can" or "should"
  prefix counters with "count" or "num"
common HTML mistakes
Let's try to use a common js coding pattern
Put code in following order
 1) variable declarations
 2) method declarations
 3) method calls
Unobtrusive JavaScript -- let's try to stick to it
common js problems, no blocks around ifs, '  ' eval, ==, var methodName = function(){}
managing code for lessons in repos, versioning
Bryan will create karma-lesson repo
  lessons will have two states "stable" or "unstable", the "stable" commit is tagged "stable"
   everything else is unstable
  will use repo-naming convention from E-Paath but prefixed w/ "karma_"
Using draggable()?
Vaibhaw will take look at jquery UI's draggable and see if useful
Create common widgets? Scorebox? timer? -- yes we need all of them
Bryan will look at dialog for help, playAgain
  Bryan will add shuffle() to Karma
timeline? milestones?
Vaibhaw will complete all 60 by March
We need resolution help! at least I do
Bryan will check w/ Om to see if lesson dimensions will be part of UI design
