Description
Sugar Snake is a fun multiplication practice game. You play a snake eating yummy "multapples" with the goal to be the largest snake ever! But watch out! Eating the wrong answers will send you off course! We have a
GitHub repository
that has instructions on installing.
To Do
Clean up the graphics especially how the snake appears in game. Add difficulty levels to allow for varying degrees of math problems. Test different implementations of the game, i.e. eating wrong problem would reduce size, not be a game over. Create a nice icon for the Sugar OS to recognize as an activity.
