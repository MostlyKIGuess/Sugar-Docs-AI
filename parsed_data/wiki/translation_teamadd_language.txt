N.B.  Langpacks are not currently available
New languages can be easily added by following the steps below.
First download the setup file for your langpack from
pootle
You can download directly in XO or copy it from your computer to your XO.
After this open terminal(I prefer virtual terminal by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F2).
Run the setup file with sudo.
For example to add missing Hindi language I'd download
http://pootle.sugarlabs.org/langpacks/0.94/hi_lang_pack_v2.sh
and run the command
sudo hi_lang_pack_v2.sh
After this open the file /usr/share/sugar/extensions/cpsection/language/model.py for edit.
Under the function read_all_languages() you'll find some lines like "locales.append(('Pashto','Afganistan','ps_AF.utf8'))
Add similar line for your language. For Hindi it would be locales.append(('Hindi','India','hi_HI.utf8'))
Note that 'Hindi' and 'India' can be anything you want it to be displayed in language drop down menu. 'hi_HI.utf8' must be the correct code for your langpack.
Now save the file and restart sugar.
You should find your new language in settings -> Language.
