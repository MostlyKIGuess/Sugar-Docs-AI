Leaving the Software Freedom Conservancy
Conservancy has suggested we leave, given the difficulties we have encountered.
We discussed,
how Sugar Labs was formed, and the advice received on this in 2008,
downsides are the time and money required,
upsides are autonomy and independence,
the need for professional advice,
the 501(c)3 model,
departure is defined in the agreement with the Conservancy,
trademarks and copyright move to the newly formed organisation,
Conservancy may place conditions on the new organisation as consent,
other organisations we might partner with,
cost of creating the organisation,
where the funds may be obtained from,
We decided to proceed, and further discussion will be private.
