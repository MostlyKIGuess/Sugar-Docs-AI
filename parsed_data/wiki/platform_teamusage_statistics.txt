Summary
Sugar usage statistics might be very useful from, e.g., an educational or research point of view. Statistics might be anonymous or personalized (by taking special efforts to keep information secure and local for use only by a particular deployment).
Counter types
Measured
statistic values might be one of the following types:
absolute
