The FourthGradeMath Archives
I'm reading the 4th Grade Math archives and collecting the questions there.  I'll leave it up to more deeply involved project members to decide whether to add these questions to the FAQ page and how to add them.

"... are we looking for teachers to be involved from a non-technical perspective?"
"Absolutely.  The sooner the better. ... But it's absolutely necessary when you're connecting activities directly to curriculum." from

"Has there been much of an effort to see what's gone before when designing Mongo?  Have folks hit the ACM SIGGRAPH library on education and games, the serious games or games 4 change mail lists and archives to look at other
efforts?"
"Mongo is my half-baked idea.  I think it's got some good instincts, but I'm certainly no game designer, and I am in no way married to it.  So long as the output is completely Free and Open Source, focuses on delivering educational content in a self-contained, modular way that clearly maps to concepts identified in curriculum frameworks, and is written in a language that the typical bright 14-year-old kid can hack (which is why I lean towards Python), I will be delighted." from
