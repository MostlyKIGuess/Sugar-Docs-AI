We have an opportunity to integrate Sugar and other software into school curricula at all levels, making it possible for children to learn ideas at earlier stages of development, and to go much deeper into those ideas. There is substantial research that we can draw on going back to the 1960s on classroom and preschool uses of computers to teach reading and writing, arithmetic, computer programming, and other subjects, but much more research is needed. Some examples include
Omar Khayyam [sic] Moore's Edison Talking Typewriter for teaching two-year-olds to read and type (assisted by a graduate student)
IBM's experiment in teaching first grade arithmetic in APL on an IBM 360 and Selectric printing terminals, led by later Turing Award winner and IBM Fellow Ken Iverson.
Seymour Papert's robot turtle graphics and Logo programming language
Alan Kay's Object-Oriented Smalltalk programming language and Dynabook educational computer designs
Projects to teach other programming languages, including BASIC and LISP, starting in third grade.
Doug Engelbart's program for Enhancing Collective Intelligence, which we now get to apply to millions of children
