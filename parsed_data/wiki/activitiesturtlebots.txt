Buti치
Project Buti치 aims to create a simple and inexpensive platform to enable students from public high schools, in coordination with teachers and inspectors of Secondary Education, to learn the programming of robots' behavior.
The Butia team is located in Uruguay, detailed documentation exists in the Spanish language:

The XO laptop sits on a baseplate which also has
2 motors
,
sensors
and a
battery pack
.
The motors and sensors interface to the XO through a small PCB, either an
Arduino Mega
and
shield
or a
Usb4butia PCB
(which uses a PIC microcontroller). The connection between the XO laptop and the small PCB is by USB cable. The cable must stay connected while the program is running.
Shown L-R, the Arduino Mega, the shield PCB which plugs into the Arduino Mega, the Usb4Butia which replaces both boards in later versions of the Butia
To install the software which runs on Usb4Butia, there is an activity
ButiaFirmware
Activity which runs on a XO.
The robot's controlling program runs on the XO laptop, typically TurtleBots, the pallette of blocks is shown below. Control by programs in
Lua
,

,
[2]
or
Python
is also possible.
