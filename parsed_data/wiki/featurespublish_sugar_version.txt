Benefit to Sugar
Until now, we needed release a new version of Browse with every Sugar release, and with the version harcoded.
But that Browse activity can run in older Sugar versions, then you can have information mismatched.
Scope
The change in Sugar is ready to land
https://github.com/godiard/sugar/commit/d5fd43b94681e93466a58c0bc81945b578bf33af
The change in Browse already landed:
https://github.com/sugarlabs/browse-activity/commit/a6fcd2c4f356b0b008ec41e14dfe0ecb431ccae8
Would be good add this information to Log activity too.
Developers should have in account check if the env variable exists or not, because activities can run in older Sugar releases, where this env variable is not available (check the Browse example).
