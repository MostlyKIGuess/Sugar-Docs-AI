How do I get TOC to work?

Ubuntu 9.04
1100 reading install instructions
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team/Jhbuild
Why? I had Sugar installed on Ubuntu 9.04 but it stopped building ~19Aug. I deleted the directory. rm -rf sugar...
1110 on irc waiting for git to finish download/ uploading video
user@ubuntu:~/sugar-jhbuild$ ./sugar-jhbuild update
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOZ8Se1TZFo
1119 ./sugar-jhbuild depscheck returns ok
1120 ./sugar-jhbuild build in process
1202 lost internet. Apparently build still pulls from repository
note use pastebin and look at errors before making fool of oneself on irc, very easy to lose cred with devs
1218 retrying at 25 of 38 now
1222 epic romance of failure: *** Installing read *** [26/38]
python setup.py install --prefix /home/user/sugar-jhbuild/install
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "setup.py", line 19, in <module>
   from sugar.activity import bundlebuilder
ImportError: No module named sugar.activity
Error during phase install of read: ########## Error running python setup.py install --prefix /home/user/sugar-jhbuild/install *** [26/38]
[1] Rerun phase install
 [2] Ignore error and continue to next module
 [3] Give up on module
 [4] Start shell
 [5] Reload configuration
This has been going on now for at least four days as of 23 Aug. Is there anyone building Sugar from Jhbuild but not on a VM?
fedora 11

.jhbuild-sugar run
got sugar started tried opening activities then it freezes whole screen
<dgd> you're going to love this... f11 jhbuild. no activities start...
<dgd> the video will be available in about 20 minutes, UI is there but activities do NOT start
<dgd> and even better, F11 just crashed...
<dgd> this machine runs fine except when running sugar...
<dgd> unfortunately video will not be available as machine has just crashed  :(

iwikiwi_ runs sugar-emulator on f11 without any problems
<iwikiwi_> dgd: also by default the dev-logging in f11 sugar is disabled, so might want to edit ~/.sugar/debug and enable logging by uncommenting them.
