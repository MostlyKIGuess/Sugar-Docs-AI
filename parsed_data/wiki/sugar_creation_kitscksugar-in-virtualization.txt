How to Clear ./sugar
When making a new VM
, to clear the Sugar Journal of old entries and to avoid identity conflicts among copies of the VM, enter the command
rm -rf ~/.sugar
in the Terminal activity. Then shutdown the VM. This will clear all Learner information on the VM and let you start with a fresh install. Skipping this will result in collisions in the Neighborhood view of the Jabber network between separate copies of the appliance. Verify the presence of the
.sugar
directory by entering
ls -a
in Terminal.
When cloning a customized VM
, in order to keep the Journal and installed .xo Activities, use
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
in the Sugar Terminal, and then
shutdown the VM
. enter in root terminal:
su (password) shutdown -h now
This leaves the Journal entries and removes only the previous Learner's identity key files.
To clear the Sugar Journal
:
rm -rf ~/.sugar/default/datastore
This may be needed if the Journal becomes clogged with too many entries.
