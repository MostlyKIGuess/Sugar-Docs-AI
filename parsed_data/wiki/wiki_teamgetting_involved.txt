Contributing
This website is free for all to edit, and contributing is extremely easy. All you need is an account for the website. You can start small by fixing typos and rewording sentences for clarity.
If you are unfamiliar with wikis, please read through this
wiki guide
before contributing. If you are familiar with Wikipedia, then the Sugar Labs wiki should seem familiar because both are based on
MediaWiki
When should you contribute? Whenever you see something that could be improved or updated! Also,
Todo List
contains details of things that need doing. If you notice an error and do not want to correct it yourself, you can report it as a
bug
.
