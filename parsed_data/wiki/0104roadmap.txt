About
Sucrose 0.103.x is an unstable development series intended for testing and
development purposes. Sucrose uses odd minor version numbers to indicate
development status, so this unstable 0.103.x series will finally become
the 0.104 stable release.
Goals
Bring Pootle back and fix translations in Sucrose 0.102.
Synchronize with Gnome and Fedora releases.
Give the community enough time to develop and upstream new features.
