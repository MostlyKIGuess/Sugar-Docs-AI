Shakyamuni Buddha (c. 563 BCE to 483 BCE)
Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.

Anonymous poem,
What is a Boy?
[sic] (1944)
He is a person who is going to carry on what you have started.
He is to sit right where you are sitting and attend when you are gone to those things you think are so important.
You may adopt all the policies you please, but how they will be carried out depends on him.
Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them.
He is going to sit at your desk in the Senate, and occupy your place on the Supreme Bench.
He will assume control of your cities, states and nations.
He is going to move in and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.
All your work is going to be judged and praised or condemned by him.
Your reputation and your future are in his hands.
All you work is for him, and the fate of the nations and of humanity is in his hands.
So it might be well to pay him some attention.

Aristotle (384 BCE–322 BCE)
All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses.
In modern times there are opposing views about the practice of education. There is no general agreement about what the young should learn either in relation to virtue or in relation to the best life; nor is it clear whether their education ought to be directed more towards the intellect than towards the character of the soul.... And it is not certain whether training should be directed at things useful in life, or at those conducive to virtue, or at non-essentials.... And there is no agreement as to what in fact does tend towards virtue. Men do not all prize most highly the same virtue, so naturally they differ also about the proper training for it. (unsourced)
Plutarch (c. 46 – 120 AD)
The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled. Alternative translation: The correct analogy for the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting...

Nothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.

Daniel Defoe (ca. 1659-1661–1731)
I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world, considering us as a civilized and a Christian country, that we deny the advantages of learning to women.

Letter to Colonel Charles Yancey (6 January 1816) ME 14:384
Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
Letter to Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours (24 April 1816)
I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.

Simon Bolivar (1783–1830)
The first duty of a government is to give education to the people.
William Blake (1757–1827)

Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in.

Henry Thomas Buckle (1821-1862)
Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest by their preference for the discussion of ideas.

John Alexander Smith (1863–1939)
Gentlemen, you are now about to embark on a course of studies which will occupy you for two years. Together, they form a noble adventure. But I would like to remind you of an important point. Nothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you in after life, save only this, that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education.
Smith was Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford University.

You must be the change you seek.
Maria Montessori (1870–1952)
The greatest sign of success for a teacher is to be able to say, "The children are now working as if I did not exist."
Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.
Robert Frost (1874–1963)
But yield who will to their separation,
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight.
Only where love and need are one,
And the work is play for mortal stakes,
Is the deed ever really done
For Heaven and the future's sakes.
Two Tramps In Mudtime
Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
It is almost a miracle that modern teaching methods have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for what this delicate little plant needs more than anything, besides stimulation, is freedom.
Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid; humans are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant; together they are powerful beyond imagination.
I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.
Pablo Picasso (1881–1973)
I am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.
Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892 – 1950)
Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
When first the shaft into his vision shone
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
Who, though once only and then but far away,
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.

Robert A. Heinlein (1907–1988)
A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
Peter Drucker (1909—2005)
The important and difficult job is never to find the right answers, it is to find the right question. For there are few things as useless—if not dangerous—as the right answer to the wrong question.

The initial motive for developing APL was to provide a tool for writing and teaching.

You don't understand anything until you learn it more than one way.
In Rebecca Herold,
Managing an Information Security and Privacy Awareness and Training Program
(2005), 101.
We like to think that a child's play is unconstrained—but when children appear to feel joyous and free, this may merely hide from their minds their purposefulness; you can see this more clearly when you attempt to drag them away from their chosen tasks. For they are exploring their worlds to see what's there, making explanations of what those things are, and imagining what else could be; exploring, explaining and learning are among a child's most purposeful urges and goals. The playfulness of childhood is the most demanding teacher we have. Never again in those children's lives will anything drive them to work so hard.
The Emotion Machine
Seymour Papert (Born 1928)
Programming a computer means nothing more or less than communicating to it in a language that it and the human user can both "understand". And learning languages is one of the things children do best. Every normal child learns to talk. Why then should a child not learn to "talk" to a computer?

This is not just a matter of giving a laptop to each child, as if bestowing on them some magical charm. The magic lies within—within each child, within each scientist, scholar, or just plain citizen in the making. This initiative is meant to bring it forth into the light of day.
Alan Kay (born 1940)
The important thing here is that the music is not in the piano. And knowledge and edification is not in the computer. The computer is simply an instrument whose music is ideas.
By the time I got to school, I had already read a couple hundred books. I knew in the first grade that they were lying to me because I had already been exposed to other points of view. School is basically about one point of view — the one the teacher has or the textbooks have. They don't like the idea of having different points of view, so it was a battle. Of course I would pipe up with my five-year-old voice.

a line I first encountered in a Robert Asprin fantasy novel.
Plato (ca. 428 BCE–347 BCE)
The greatest principle of all is that nobody, whether male or female, should be without a leader. Nor should the mind of anybody be habituated to letting him (or her) do anything at all on his (or her) own initiative–to his leader he shall direct his eye and follow him faithfully. And even in the smallest matter he should stand under leadership. For example, he should get up, or move, or wash, or take his meals...only if he has been told to do so. In a word, he should teach his soul, by long habit, never to dream of acting independently, and to become utterly incapable of it.

Addresses to the German Nation
John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)
A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation; in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body. An education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exists at all, as one among many competing experiments...

« Quand il naît par mutation dans les jardins une rose nouvelle, voilà tous les jardiniers qui s’émeuvent. On isole la rose, on cultive la rose, on la favorise. Mais il n’est point de jardinier pour les hommes. Mozart enfant sera marqué comme les autres par la machine à emboutir...Ce qui me tourmente,...c’est un peu, dans chacun de ces hommes,
Mozart assassiné

"When a mutant rose arises in a garden, all the gardeners rejoice. They give it a special place, they cultivate it, they bestow all their care on it. But there are no gardeners for people. An infant Mozart is marked just like all the others by the stamping press...What torments me is...in each of these people, a bit of Mozart murdered."
Richard Feynman (1918–1988)
I got a telephone call from a pretty famous lawyer here in Pasadena, Mr. Norris, who was at that time on the State Board of Education. He asked me if I would serve on the State Curriculum Commission, which had to choose the new schoolbooks for the state of California...
I had a special bookshelf put in my study downstairs (the books took up seventeen feet), and began reading all the books that were going to be discussed in the next meeting. We were going to start out with the elementary schoolbooks...
It was a pretty big job, and I worked all the time at it down in the basement. My wife says that during this period it was like living over a volcano. It would be quiet for a while, but then all of a sudden, "BLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!" -- there would be a big explosion from the "volcano" below.
The reason was that the books were so lousy. They were false. They were hurried. They would try to be rigorous, but they would use examples (like automobiles in the street for "sets") which were almost OK, but in which there were always some subtleties. The definitions weren't accurate. Everything was a little bit ambiguous -- they weren't smart enough to understand what was meant by "rigor." They were faking it. They were teaching something they didn't understand, and which was, in fact, useless, at that time, for the child.
