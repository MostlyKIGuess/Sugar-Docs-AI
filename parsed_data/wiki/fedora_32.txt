Install of IIAB on RPi4
"The Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest upgrade in the Raspberry Pi SBC series. :
This one has a Quadcore A72 CPU, up to 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 2x USB 2.0, 2x USB 3.0 ports, double micro-HDMI ports, AC Wifi, Bluetooth 5.0 and Gigabit ethernet."
NOTE medium and full install include sugarizer-server (default)

Same install on a 32GB sd: using my Rpi3B+.
Only difference: used medium install and only downloaded a few items to test
Aug 2 2017
Installed "Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software" (1)
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_full_latest
(2019-07-10)
2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-full.img (extracted: 6.4 GB)
256 GB SanDisk Ultra micoSDXC A1 card
Install with Etcher:
https://www.balena.io/etcher/
In microSD reader
Insert card in RPi4 and power up:
RPi4 (with 4 GB Memory) booted and changed GPU memory in "Preferences / Raspberry Pi4 Configuration" to [356] from [76]
( 2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-full - allows changing the allocated amount of memory in the RPi4)
(This appears to increase performance)
https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/configuration/raspi-config.md#memory-split
in add/remove software: install firefox ESR
in terminal:
curl d.iiab.io/install.txt | sudo bash
chose maximum iiab install size
used middle selection for type of install (single point)
Start Ansible install
Photograph terminal screen when it shows: "Internet-In-A Box (IIAB) software install is complete"
Reboot (by hitting [enter] key)
Change iiab-admin's password before connecting your server to the Internet.
You can do this within
http://box.lan/admin
-> Utilities menu — or at the command line, if you type "passwd iiab-admin".
in firefox enter (in command line): 10.0.0.208/admin with user:iiab-admin and the password you entered above ^
Starts Admin console

NOTES
run iiab-hotspot-on and iiab-hotspot-off which are found in /usr/bin — these are especially useful after you've used a Raspberry Pi's internal Wi-Fi to download IIAB and content.

still in development
"Fedora Silverblue is an immutable desktop operating system, which aims to be extremely stable and reliable. It also aims to be an excellent platform for developers and for those using container-focused workflows."
flatpaks
"A universal packaging format with a decentralized means of distribution. Plus, portability and sandboxing."
Many soas (sugar) apps are being converted to flatpacks which install into f32 #silverblue and f31 workstation.
this may be the future for sugar

"Thanks Samson.
For Sugar Labs, the most important part is "the machines will have the
same modules (interface) for children lesson," so there's an
opportunity for Sugar Labs to remain involved.
I don't know what operating system REB are using, but OLPC OS 18.04.0
based on Ubuntu 18.04.2 and Sugar will likely work straight away on
PC-compatible laptops, and can be customised and rebuilt.  Our OLPC
servers do see update requests from countries were we have not
distributed our PC-compatible laptops, which is cool."
