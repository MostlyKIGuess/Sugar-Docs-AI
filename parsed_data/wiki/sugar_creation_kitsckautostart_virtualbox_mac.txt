Where we need to simplify
We need a simple, elegant, Sugar specific UI that is presented to the user when they insert a stick into a running Windows machine.
Suggestion-1:
Download the 2 files for VirtualBox import to a 2nd USB stick
On insertion; the contents of the USB stick pop up
An example:
 f16-live-RC4-Desktop-sugaruser-disk1.vmdk
 f16-live-RC4-Desktop-sugaruser.ovf
<==click on this file and it immediately imports into VirtualBox (less than 2 Minutes)
(Only the .ovf file icon is highlighted in the USB stick contents)
Suggestion-2:
Export the VirtualBox .vdi hard drive to a 2nd USB and create a new machine that uses the .vdi to run
/home/(user)/VirtualBox VMs/ (copy all three files to USB-stick)
Create a new appliance
use pre-existing hard disk
Look for .vdi (on USB-stick)
