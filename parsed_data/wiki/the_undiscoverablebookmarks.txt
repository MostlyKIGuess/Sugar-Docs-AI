It is easy to save a bookmark in Browse. On the Browse tab, click the star. The bookmarked page appears as a thumbnail in a linear list at the bottom of the screen. Click one of the thumbnails to go to that page.
To remove a bookmark, hover until the menu appears, or right-click to get the menu. Then select Remove.
The View tab has an icon for toggling the view of the Bookmark list. If it happens to be toggled off, there is no visual indication of saving a bookmark.
There are no other Bookmark management functions in the UI.
