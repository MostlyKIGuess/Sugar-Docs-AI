Targeted release: 0.88
Last updated: 09.12.2009
Percentage of completion: 0%
Detailed Description
We have the issue that the information about a datastore entry is not always the same in the Journal and in the activity. For example, if you use the Journal to edit ANY of the metadata (favourite star state, title, description, tags, while that activity entry is running, switching focus to that activity and back to the Journal will wipe all your changes (
#1358
).
Benefit to Sugar
I have actually seen this error leading to significant data loss in the field. Learners adding a detailed description to a Journal entry or changing the title while the activity is still open wipes out the data when switching back to the activity.
