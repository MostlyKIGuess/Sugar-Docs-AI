To be a welcoming global community where anyone can learn how to develop high-quality libre software that facilitates learning through self-discovery and collaboration among young children of all continents, and to make that software easily available to learners and teachers.
The mission of Sugar Labs is to produce, distribute, and support the use of the
Sugar learning platform
; it is a support base and gathering place for the community of educators and developers to create, extend, teach, and learn with the Sugar learning platform.
Sugar is based on the following
principles
:
everyone is a teacher and a learner;
humans by their nature are social beings;
humans by their nature are expressive;
you learn through doing; and
love is a better master than duty.
