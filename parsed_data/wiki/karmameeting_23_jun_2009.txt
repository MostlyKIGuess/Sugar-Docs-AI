Subzero still working on finishing and optimizing Quadrilaterals
Primary cause of slowness in Quadrilaterals, constant redrawing of line segment in
290-296
problems w/ current Quadrilaterals activity
Using absolute and not relative positions in css, this could cause problems going b/w different machines
Not using regular DOM elements for buttons -- but this is easy to fix and u can just do it on the next activity
Constant line redrawing -- hardest problem
Next task after improving quadrilaterals - recreate the "Counting up to 10" learning activity, with Spanish and Nepali versions, probably start this task next week
i18n
