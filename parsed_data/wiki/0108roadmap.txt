Sucrose
0.107.x
is an
unstable
development series intended for testing and development purposes. Sucrose uses odd minor version numbers to indicate development status, so an unstable 0.107.x series will finally become the
0.108 stable
release.
Goals
Improve stability.
Fix collaboration.
Catch up with more Gtk changes.
