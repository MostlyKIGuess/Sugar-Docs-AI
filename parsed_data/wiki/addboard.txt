Addboard
Addboard is a simple addition based board game that will hopefully teach 4th grade students basic addition and problem solving.
The Board
Base Implementation
Addboard's puzzles are based around moving your single circle around the board within a set amount of turns. The goal is to reach the middle white square by using the numbers around your circle to navigate your way through the maze. The player moves the set amount of space in the direction of the number they move towards. The numbers on the board are semi-random. In the loop that creates the board, each number is first assigned a value based on its distance from the row or column of the goal square. Depending on its position in the loop, it will check its distance from either the left or right of the goal’s column, or from below or above the goal’s row, then assign that value to the square. This assures that at least half of the squares on the board will take you directly to the column or row of the goal square, assuming you are able to approach the square from the right direction.
Curriculum
Addboard will adhere to the New York State and Massachusetts math curriculum for first grade students (Section 1.OA). The board will teach basic addition and problem solving in a fun and interesting way.
Concept
The board is required to have a an exit square and a starting square. The puzzle becomes larger and larger after each level and gives the player an increasing amount of tries per level.
Addition
The board uses smaller numbers in the first few levels, then increases in complexity in increasing levels. The problem solving implements finding the optimal path to the middle. Addition is a work in progress.
Problem Solving
Figuring out the optimal path to the middle.
Mechanics
General Mechanics
The player will move around the board following the direction and path of the number that is directly next to the players location. The player must find the optimal path to the middle white square.
Movement
The controls are simple arrow keys. Move the character to each corresponding square with the arrow keys.
Exit Square
The exit square is the end of the level. The player needs to directly land onto the square.
Aesthetics
Look
The game borrows from the phone game phenomena. Block looking squares with a simple solid color.
Instruction
None yet. Work in Progress.
Installation
It's not currently installable on the XO BUT it's playable from terminal. Currently we are working on fixing the installation of the game.
