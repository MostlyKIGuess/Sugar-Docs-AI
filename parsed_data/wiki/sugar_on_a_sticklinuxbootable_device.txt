These instructions help with determining and setting disk partitions as bootable devices.
Note
: This page is transcluded in other instruction pages.
Check the disk partition table for a device, such as
/dev/sdc
,
sudo fdisk
-l
/dev/sdc
<----that's a lowercase letter 'L' for the
l
ist option.
You should see something like the following:
$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc

Disk /dev/sdc: 4012 MB, 4012900352 bytes
124 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1019 cylinders, total 7837696 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x0000a9c7

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdc1   *          62     7834071     3917005    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
The asterisk,
*
, under the Boot column indicates that the partition is bootable.
If it is missing, then execute the commands here:
parted /dev/sd

toggle 1 boot
quit
