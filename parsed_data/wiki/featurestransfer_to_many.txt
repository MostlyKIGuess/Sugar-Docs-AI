Detailed Description
At the moment it is only possible to transfer a Journal entry to another learner one by one. Teachers have asked that they would like to transfer a file to all the class for example easily (hand out a book, asignment etc).
Benefit to Sugar
We make the transfer of a Journal item to many learners easier.
Implementation plan
One simple idea is to add an entry to the Journal item palette that does a 'send-to-all friends'.
Scope
The shell has to change.
UI Design
The question is where to place the option in the palette. As the first option which might cause accidental triggering. Furthermore the way we handle the transfer related notifications in the frame should change (
as described here
). Something else to consider is the grouping. Currently the only option to tag a group of people is to friend them.
