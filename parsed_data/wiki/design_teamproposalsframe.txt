Reveal/Hide Frame
Reveal/Hide Frame using the Hot corners
go with your mouse cursor one one of the corners to reveal the Frame
move with the mouse cursor out of the Frame to hide it again
Reveal/Hide Frame using the keyboard
use the dedicated Frame key (or F6) to reveal the Frame
use the dedicated Frame key (or F6) to hide the Frame
any cursor movement has no effect
Reveal/Hide Frame using a gesture
using a gesture like a swipe to one of the corners to reveal the Frame
will that be the same behavior as with the hot corners or as with the dedicated key?
Introduce Frame
The Frame is one of the components of the Shell that is not discoverable that easy, we might want to do an animation to help that.
