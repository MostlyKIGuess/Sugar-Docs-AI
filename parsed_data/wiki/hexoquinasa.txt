A Sugar Distribution for Humans with Good Intentions
Hexoquinasa is a Sugar Distribution based on
Harmonic Distribution
developed jointly by
SomosAZUCAR
and Sugar Labs's
Platform Team
in collaboration with the Sugar community.
It has been strategically designed to support the active involvement of the Sugar Labs Perú Local Lab with the Peruvian OLPC XO Deployment.
Our technical goal is
usability
and supportability in difficult deployment scenarios (such as remote, offline deployments).
However Hexoquinasa also has a
social
component: Hexoquinasa will emphasize software freedom, community building, native language support and content distribution among peers and the wider Sugar community.
