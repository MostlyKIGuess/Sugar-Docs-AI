Kia ora
I am Tabitha Roder. I coordinate the
volunteer efforts in New Zealand
. We have a volunteer group based in Wellington that started meeting weekly middle of 2008 and are still going strong.   We have another volunteer group in Auckland who also meet weekly. We are spreading out across the country, with volunteers in Christchurch, Tauranga, and Hamilton.
We use
laptop.org.nz
to keep people informed about what we are doing.

In January 2010 I was education miniconf organiser at
LCA2010
where we showed the XO laptop and had a hacking sugar session. I also ensure XOs make it to other events related to education and or to computing.
