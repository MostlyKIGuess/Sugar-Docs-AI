After an extended mailing list discussion, Greg and I are going to put our money where our mouth is. He needs stickers for FOSDEM. I want stickers to spread happily through Boston. We are both plonking down some cash. I am placing a print order in 48 hours from this timestamp:

I need a design to print, preferably in the form of a witty sticker design. By default I'll grab something from
http://sugarlabs.org/go/MarketingTeam/Logo
and run, but I'll be tearing around Wellington and the internet trying to get help to make this snazzier.
If you also want stickers, you've got 48 hours to tell me how many you want to add to the print run and give me a way to get them to you (bus and/or plane tickets preferred, but self-addressed-stamped-envelopes acceptable  ;)  We may not get all the requests in this time, but we'll post images and such so folks can make a second run themselves. Stickers are cheap (see
http://www.stickergiant.com/custom_stickers/
and similar sites).
