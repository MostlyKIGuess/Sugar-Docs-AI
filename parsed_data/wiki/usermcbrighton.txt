Hi, my name is Mark Brighton. I am a Software Engineer by education.  I've generally worked in embedded software (mostly in C), but have experience with Python.  I live in the Northeast.
I've used Linux both at home and work for a couple of years now.  I've really benefited from the work of the open-source community and I'm excited to contribute.
I've started looking at the Lemonade Stand project that was started by several RIT students.
I've also noticed a Masters paper on math education:
