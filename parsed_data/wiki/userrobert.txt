I was with OLPC until the end of 2011. I still remain involved in the project in broader advocacy and policy recommendations primarily with the Global Education Cluster Working Group. You can read my OLPC bio [

].
I was happy to offer my financial expertise to SLOBs and even happier that it was accepted. I hope that my reporting and analysis will help make their management and decision making easier.
