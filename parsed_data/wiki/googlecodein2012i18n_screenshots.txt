--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
We use screen shots extensively in Sugar for documentation. The problem is, these are PNG by default, which means that it is difficult render any strings that need translation.
Task
Identify and document a generalized (ideally automated) method for taking nearly identical screen shots with the desktop set to a selected list of different languages. (Possibly
Orca
?).
