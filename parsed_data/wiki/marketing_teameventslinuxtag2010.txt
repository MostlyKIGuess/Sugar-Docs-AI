Sugar Activities
Sugar does advocate the concepts of activities - you learn through doing, so if you want more learning you want more doing. So the Sugar Labs team wants to get engaged at Linuxtag:
We will have a booth at Linuxtag, like we had last year, more information can be found below.
Sebastian Dziallas, one of the main figures behind Sugar on a Stick will be talking about leveraging communities. The talk
The Open Source Way: Leveraging Communities
will be Friday, 11.06.2010, 10:30-11:00 o'clock in the room Europa II.
Sugar Booth
Please list your availability if you are interested in helping with the booth. Or if you already know which shifts you want to take, feel free to add yourself in the second table. German skills are welcome - but not needed. Ideally a shift is two people, but given the space reserved at the booth size I think we can get away with one as well. Helping at the booth means answering questions regarding Sugar and Sugar Labs and the largest deployer of Sugar One Laptop Per Child (OLPC). Of course you don't have to be an expert in all of the areas. Furthermore we will have hardware for demoing Sugar and flashing Sugar on a Stick (Soas) on request.
People helping at the booth will get a Linuxtag ticket.
