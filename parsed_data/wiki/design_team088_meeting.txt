Resume/Start new on the Home View
Mailing list discussion
Design:
1. Go back to the "start new" behavior when you left click on the icon
2. Keep the options to resume recent activities in the secondary options 
of the palette
3. Keep the palette behavior as they are
4. Keep the alt-click shortcut to toggle the view
5. Add the Journal to the activity ring (at the top) in the Home view, colored to make it accessible in the home view all the time
6. Add a list of the n most recent activities to the Journal's secondary palette to be able to resume from
Christian has phrased out a
test case
that will bring us data to evaluate 'Start new" vs "Resume in Home View". The tests will be conducted in the Pilot in Berlin and in the Pierre Van Cortlandt Middle School in Croton on Hudson, New York in the week of the 8-12th of February.
Needed: Images that can be used in the test runs.

3G Support
Allow the Sugar user to connect to 3G networks.
Feature Page
Design: A device will be added to the frame when a modem is connected, and the user will be able to connect and disconnect from there. Also, a section will be added to the control panel that will allow entering the details needed by the connection.
Needed: Icon to represent the connection in the frame and is used in the Control Panel section. First patch has been landed. Refinements are needed, especially feedback for the user in cases of errors.
1. the disconnect option in the device icon palette should use an icon 
just like other network devices.
2. the connection time should be shown in the primary palette, eg. 
"connected for 02:22" instead
3. data sent: make that: [UP] 23kb [DOWN] 31 kb
4. left align the options in the control panel
5. ? help in the control panel section ?
Write to Journal anytime
Replacement for the Naming Alert that lets you write to the Journal at any time while working on an activity.
Feature Page
Mailing list discussion
Proposal of option in the activity toolbar.
Design: Instead of the naming alert when you close an activity for the first time we will switch to the Journal detail few of the activity. The back button on the detail page will bring you, like in general Journal use, to the main Journal page. The NamingAlert will go away.
Needed: Patch to show new behavior.
Font configuration
Users need a way to be able to customize the Sugar font size.
Feature page
Design: A control panel section from within the learner can modify the Font size. The page will present the user with a slider to adjust the size and a preview of the changes he makes.
Needed: Icon, Yevlempy is working on the implementation.

Drag icon
What image should be used for drag icon for:
list view
thumbs view
Sugars <0.84 used nasty default icon, 0.86 uses default TreeView method - row snapshot. Last method will look nice especially for thumb view but there is an issue, draging large row(list view) or cell(thumbs view) user doesn't see target drop place e.g. icon in volume list

mockup was implemented

Is it right if only widgets(Journal related, pure text from could be dragged as usual) that could be dragged are object icon in list view and thumb in thumbs view?
implementing scheme when any space in row(list view) and cell(thumbs view) could be dragged is(of course) possible in new journal but requires not obvious coding
does it make sense if empty space(in list view row) could be dragged as journal object, moreover it's easy to make a mistake and drag wrong object
objects could be dragged by icon/thumb or title

Hover over mode
Should ObjectChooser highlight current item, <=0.84 has this feature, 0.86 doesn't.
highlighting was reverted

Enhanced Color Selector
This is an enhancement to the color selector used in the About Me control panel and the initialization screen (same behavior but a different code base). It enables the user to cycle through color choices as well as jump randomly, which is the current default behavior.
Feature Page
Mailing list discussion
The latest question was: Do we need the color selector in the start-screen at all?
