Sucrose
0.109.x
was an
unstable
development series intended for testing and development purposes. Sucrose uses odd minor version numbers to indicate development status, so an unstable 0.109.x series did finally become the
0.110 stable
release.
Testing
Fedora 23/24/rawhide:
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/samtoday/sugar/
