Title: Goals/2018 Submissions/Teachers Guide for Sugar/Sugarizer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal
Sugar needs to be easier for teachers to try. Running Sugar in a browser is the natural solution and adheres to Sugar's hardware-agnostic position. Sugarizer should be the focus of marketing efforts but needs a "teacher's guide" to help teachers evaluate and choose Sugar for the classroom. Teachers can't spend time troubleshooting technical issues, which makes deploying Sugar on non-XO hardware problematic.
Suggested Timeframe
Six months would be sufficient to prepare evaluation and training materials for teachers
