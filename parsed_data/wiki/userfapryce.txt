About Me
How I Got Involved in this Project
Although I'd heard about OLPC before, I didn't really know a lot about the laptops until last Spring when I went to a seminar in GCCIS (RIT's Golisano College for Computing and Information Sciences) and some people who work with OLPC came to talk about the project and the laptops. I really liked the whole concept of the project, the design of the XO's and the thought behind the design. I also learned that OLPC was looking for more people to help out with the Networking side of the project, so I signed up.
Current Project
I am looking to assist with the Moodle Implementation Plan for the XS.
