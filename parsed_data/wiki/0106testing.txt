Testing with images
OLPC did release OLPC OS 13.2.5 with Sugar 0.106.  Please see the
release notes for 13.2.5
.
We have older Sugar Labs images with Sugar 0.105.1. These are "clean" images, with no customization.  These images are NOT signed by OLPC, therefore you need an unlocked XO for installing these images.
