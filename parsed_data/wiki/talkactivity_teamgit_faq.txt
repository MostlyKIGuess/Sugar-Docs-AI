Title: Talk:Activity Team/Git FAQ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I find out what is in a git repository? I have started to use sugar-jhbuild, but I don't see how to check for added activities without downloading everything.--

Sorry to be so long in replying to this question. Actually, I am not sure I understand the question. You can examine the contents of a git repository by browsing the entry in gitorious.
sugar-jubuild update
should be used to check for updates to Sugar, including new activities.
where did the misc. questions go?
Thanks to dfarning for cleaning up the Git FAQ, but where did the misc. FAQ go? There was useful information for activity developers in that section that was perhaps only tangentially related to git. I have another entry for that section:
Same as it ever was (
Activity_Team/FAQ
). --

When should I clone my project?
You should clone your project if you are going to experiment with major revisions. You should also clone you project if you want to make revisions while feature freeze is in effect. (This latter restriction only applies to Sucrose project.) You can merge your changes once you are ready to commit your changes or your feature-freeze exemption has been approved.  --
