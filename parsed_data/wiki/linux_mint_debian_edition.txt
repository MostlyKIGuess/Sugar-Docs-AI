Better sound support (addressing conflicts between Pulse Audio and Flash)
Updated software and packages
NOTES
LMDE uses rolling updates; so once installed it becomes current version each time it is updated.
Use linuxmint-debian-201101-gnome-dvd-i386.iso older versions (including torrents) were bad
Make USB Installer Stick
We actually made the ISO compatible with unetbootin so you may have more luck there.

Notes for Installation on VirtualBox 4.0
Use gparted on Live DVD to format the 8-10 GB VirtualBox HD
/boot ext4 500   /7000 ext4   swap=balance
Install to HD
edit partitions to format as ext4 and as /boot; /; and swap
Finish installation and reboot
Note this same procedure works to install to a 8 GB USB disk
2 GB Live USB disk

How to write to USB disk
Download to desktop
Use "mount command to see USB address: ie: /dev/sdb; /dev/sdc; /dev/sdd....etc
Or use gparted to see USB address
dd command is VERY DANGEROUS; if you use wrong address you will distroy your Hard Drive with no warning.
In root terminal #:
cd Desktop
dd if=linuxmint-debian-201101-gnome-dvd-i386.img of=/dev/sd(x)
How to Make a 2 GB Installer USB disk
Use the 32 bit version to make a 32 bit USB disk and 64 bit to make 64 bit USB disk
