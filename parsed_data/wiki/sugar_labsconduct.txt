There is a current code of conduct which dates back to 2009 at
Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct
. The following is a proposed update of it. A motion to adopt it will be made when there's been some discussion.
￼
Why have a Code of Conduct?
Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The Sugar Labs contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Sugar effectively, productively, and respectfully.
The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Sugar Labs to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.
With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.
