Case 1-non-live USB/SD
Make second live USB from iso downloaded with wget to root of your USB/SD
(I used Bernie's Blueberry-Direct ext3 non-live real file system, expanded with gparted to fit a 8-GB SD card)

(modified and expanded version)
Downloaded to root:
wget
http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/nightly-composes/soas/soas-i386-20100411.16.iso
(latest)
[root@localhost ~]# ./modified_livecd-iso-to-disk soas-i386-20100411.16.iso /dev/sd(*)1    *(see note below)
Verifying image...
/root/soas-i386-20100411.16.iso:   ca444a0f44d7b49204cec4f3022c3c97
Fragment sums: 5fba13ea314eeb4376b2d3a6411a4ae5aa95d38aea691e12fb86adfe88df
Fragment count: 20
Checking: 100.0%
The media check is complete, the result is: PASS.
It is OK to use this media.
Already set up as live image.
Deleting old OS in fifteen seconds...
Copying live image to USB stick
Updating boot config file
Installing boot loader
USB stick set up as live image!
Case 2-Copy files to your Live USB
Copy-paste/drag-drop soas-i386-20100405.17.iso (or any soas .iso) to an opened 2-GB live USB while it is mounted in a PC (as a USB storage device, not booted).
(This is the same location seen when the USB is booted and one is looking at the /mnt/live/ directory in the Sugar Terminal activity.)
Copy-paste modified_livecd-iso-to-disk to the same location.
Reboot from USB
reboot a computer from this USB device and proceed to write it to another 2-GB USB device:
Here is an alternate method to obtain the script file:
In the Terminal Activity, change the working directory:
cd /mnt/live
wget
http://people.sugarlabs.org/fgrose/modified_livecd-iso-to-disk
chmod +x modified_livecd-iso-to-disk
Make new USB
cd /mnt/live/
./modified_livecd-iso-to-disk soas-i386-20100405.17.iso /dev/sd(*)1
NOTE: /dev/sd(*)1 (the 1 is important)
type mount to find your USB device name
Works fine....
It should work with any live cd.iso
Obsolete?
This page appears to be rather stale.... is any of it still current?Â :)
