The problems teachers complain about
Students remove useful Journal objects to free the space for other purposes.
Lack of storage space on the XO to keep all the objects kids want
Having only the current backup procedure (backup/restore entirely journal) is awkward. If you need to keep only particular objects, this workflow is too ineffective and force users to calculate trade-offs between loosing some files in order to restore others.
