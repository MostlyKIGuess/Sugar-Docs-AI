There is a command called
multitail
that I use every day because it's really helpful on developing Sugar Activities. I use it to read the latest log that an Activity wrote and see how it's growing, similar what I do with the common
tail -f
option with the difference that
multitail
will look for the latest one.
For example, if we run an Activity three times it will create 3 different
.log
files behind
~/.sugar/default/logs
directory. With
multitail
we will be seeing the most recent version of the activity log.
Here are the steps that I did to use this command (on Fedora 17):
Install the command
sudo yum install multitail
Show the proper log files
cd ~/.sugar/default/logs
multitail -iw "*GetBooks*" 1 -m 0
-iw
is to inform to multitail about the input files and check for them every 1 second
-m
is to let multitail know about the buffersize (0 is infinite)
