How to install from the repo on the DVD
[Bug 888307]--
Satellit
12:35, 18 December 2012 (EST)
--- Comment #1 from Andre Robatino <robatino@fedoraproject.org> ---
I've found (testing on F17) that if I create a local.repo file in
 /etc/yum.repos.d/ with the contents:

 [local]
 name=Local
 baseurl=file:///dev/sr0/
 enabled=0
 gpgcheck=0

I  can then use the DVD as a local repo (disabling all other repos to avoid
downloading updated packages) with a command such as
yum --disablerepo=\* --enablerepo=local install XXXXX

Put it in a USB stick and anaconda will use it to repeat install.

Do not install kernel if upgrading to f19
"... So I installed fedora-release from the F19 repo and did a yum 
distro-sync today. Then I installed a new kernel build. Then I rebooted.
Then nothing would boot at all.
It turns out this is because the release name of Fedora 19 is:
Schrödinger's Cat
with a single quote used as an apostrophe. That release name gets 
written into the grub entry for a kernel when you're installing it.
...The single quote in the release name terminates the quotes early, and leaves the rest of the 
stuff that's meant to be inside the single quotes as garbage lying 
around the config file. ..."

Build Your Own Remix with Fedora

Tutorial with narrated screenshots
Kernel_modules
Kernel_modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.
Live media Creator
livemedia-creator is now included in Lorax as of release 17.1 and can be used to create live iso's using modified spin kickstarts.
Fedora 17 LiveCD's will continue to use livecd-creator.
Fedora 18 will use livemedia-creator to create LiveCDs. This will require changing how koji is used for the LiveCD builds.
sugar-build
http://sugarlabs.org/~buildbot/docs/build.html
Daniel Narvaez has made a number of improvements to sugar-build,
which has by-and-large replaced sugar-jhbuild as the preferred development environment for Fedora and Ubuntu.
