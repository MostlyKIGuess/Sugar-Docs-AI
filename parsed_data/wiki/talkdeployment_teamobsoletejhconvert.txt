How does one update the version of an activity included in Honey? e.g., I'd like TurtleArt v36 included instead of v16 as listed. Thanks. --

in that case there is only one way - uninstall native package and install activity from .xo; anyway honey packages will be excluded from jhconvert since we are switching to aslo; and sucrose components should up-to-date all time
