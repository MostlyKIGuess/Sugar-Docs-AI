--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-conference community meetup
Bernie gives an overview of the current state of Sugar Labs:
infrastructure (servers, services, etc.) in in place
mode of governance has been established
getting away from the
old mindset
(thinking like a company, asking for permission before doing something)
show me the code
, we will support you but you should do things yourself
Sugar Labs is a community
not
a company
more developers are needed
people should be pointed to join.sugarlabs.org
a few thousand dollars have been collected via individual donations
no success in getting grants so far
Sugar Labs has no employees, should work like the Gnome foundation, people getting paid by companies who want Sugar to suceed
in the larger context Sugar Labs should be responsible for high-levels decisions and setting the framework for activities
focus on setting up Local Sugar Labs, direct contact to educators and other relevant parties in their respective communities
Remora
as a central hub for activities (downloads, reviews, etc.); should be available in a couple of weeks
Collaboration:
(as previously also discussed on the mailing-list) it would be good to have a minimum-level of collaboration in all activities in the form of a view-only mode
activities should also declare a max. number of collaborators, any additional users who join are automatically connected in a view-only mode
Sugar 0.86:
goal is to make Sugar more usable in the classroom and for teachers
define a process to help deverlopers in finding what's important in the classroom (
participatory design
,
educator-driven development
)
announce a call-for-proposals to aid in the collection of ideas, desired features, etc. for the next release
end of call in mid-March
don't make promises whether these things will be implemented (because most of them won't be!)
Sugar 0.84 demo by Tomeu:
To-Do:
Update FlossManuals and other documentation for the 0.84 release by early March (=>contact FlossManuals folks and others who have previously already contributed to documentation efforts)
Maybe make a nice video intro highlighting the new features
neighborhood view will only show 40 XOs when connected to an ejabberd server due to the use of collabora-gadget
there's a server running at jabber.sugarlabs.org
Mesh circle / networks not shown in the neighborhood view anymore, only in the frame
the
Start
menu (currently only accessible via hovering over the center of the homeview) is no accessible from the frame and also the neighborhood view
coloured icons in the home-view indicate that the last instance / Journal entry of the respective activity will be launched
devices such as removable storage is now also viewable in the frame
Journal includes an icon for "favorites-only" search
view-source (fn + space) now opens source code for activities in a view-only mode and saves them in the Journal
apart from a regular Testing team that mainly looks for bugs there's also a need for a dedicated UI testing effort to evaluate UI changes
