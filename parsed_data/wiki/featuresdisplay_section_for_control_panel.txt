Benefit to Sugar
There are times when you would like to be able to attach a projector to your Sugar presentation. It would be convenient to be able to do this through the control panel rather than from the command line.

a new icons were added to share/icons/sugar/scalable/devices:
vga.svg
a new section was added to sugar/extensions/cpsection
display
a new icon was added to sugar/data/icons
module_display.svg
How To Test
Features/Display section for control panel/Testing
User Experience
When a projector is available, it is great to be able to take advantage of it. This will make it easy for a teacher unfamiliar with the command line and xrandr to enable VGA out.
Note that the section only will appear on non-XO hardware. There is no change to user experience with Sugar on XO platforms.
Dependencies
No additional dependencies are required to implement this feature.
Contingency Plan
None necessary, revert to previous release behavior.
