Title: Oversight Board/Decisions
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Decisions#2020-11-11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This page (largely complete) is intended to be a one-stop place for reviewing all of the Sugar Labs oversight board (SLOB) actions and decisions.
The date headlines are the date a motion is agreed, disagreed, or - in the case of motions to be voted on via email within 7 days of posting which did not get voted on - failed by timing out.
We welcome non-member proposals at the time of a meeting; but they require both a proposer and seconder from among the members of the board.  Several proposals that were not taken as motions are shown here struck out, as in

2017-09-15
AGREED MOTION 2017-16 Proposed by Walter Bender, seconded by Samson Goddy
Motion: To answer the questions posed by the SFC regarding the xo-computer icon as follows:
(Q1) Why is the XO logo included in the sugar-artwork repo now -- and does the SLOBs want to keep it there?
(A1) The xo-computer icon has been part of Sugar since we first designed and built Sugar (beginning in 2006) and we would like to keep it there until such time as the design team decides there is a reason to change it.
(Q2) Assuming the SLOBs want to keep the XO logo in sugar-artwork: what outcome would the SLOBs *prefer* to see happen?  E.g.,
- Does Sugar want downstream users to be able to redistribute and modify Sugar's codebase with or without the XO trademark file included in the program?
- Does the SLOBs want downstream users to be able to modify and redistribute the XO trademark image itself, or is that less important to Sugar?
(A2) Sugar Artwork, including the xo-computer icon, is currently licensed under the GPL and we would like our downstream users to be able to use all of our artwork under the terms of that license. As far as the use of any trademark image outside of the context of Sugar, we have no opinion.

FAILED MOTION 2017-12 Proposed by Walter Bender, seconded by Samson Goddy
Motion: Samson Goddy has been selected as a Sugar Labs representative to the Google Summer of Code mentor summit. He has requested a travel advance to cover the costs of his visa application. The advance, including wire fees comes to $US 627.05. This motion is to approve the travel advance. (As additional background, Google will be covering up to $2200 in travel expenses for two representatives to attend the summit. Since our other representative is local to the SF area, the bulk of that money would be available to cover Samson's travel, so the net impact on SL funds will be negligible.

AGREED MOTION 2016-42B (formerly 2016-42) Walter Bender, posting motion initially drafted by Caryl Bigenho (member) and Tony Anderson (SLOB) and Adam Holt (SLOB)
The Sugar Labs Oversight Board shall appoint a Finance Manager by majority vote from among the members of Sugar Labs Oversight Board. The Finance Manager serves at the will of the board. The Finance Manager may be paid a stipend at the discretion of the board. Duties of the Finance Manager will be to: 1. Serve as Sugar Lab's central coordinator on all financial matters. 2. Report quarterly at a scheduled Oversight Board meeting the following: Confirmation of the accuracy of the previous quarter's report according to the Software Freedom Conservancy; Balance at the beginning of the quarter preceding the meeting; Expenses during the quarter; Income received during the quarter; Balance at the end of the quarter. 3. The Finance Manager has discretion to approve petty cash amounts up to $200 to pay for miscellaneous expenditures critical for the functioning of Sugar Labs. If approved and everything is in order, these will often be paid within (about) 30 days of when they are submitted to the Software Freedom Conservancy, who control Sugar Labs' banking. If not approved, the applicant is free to ask for a vote at a future Oversight Board meeting. 4. All motions for funding of larger projects will be presented first to the Finance Manager who will review them to be sure the funds are being used in a way that appears fiscally sound. If everything is in order, the Finance Manager will place the motion on the agenda for consideration at the next possible Oversight Board meeting, and circulate on the IAEP mailing list for public discussion. 5. At the meeting, after a finance motion has been moved and seconded, discussion should be confined to the motion.

AGREED MOTION 2016-34 Walter Bender, posting motion initially drafted by Dave Crossland
Whereas it is the general policy of Sugar Labs to retain all GSoC mentoring stipends in the General Fund, if a mentor asks a GSoC Admin (for example in 2016, Walter or Lionel) to pay a stipend to a mentor, their share of the stipend amount will be disbursed without further motions to approve the spending. The share is calculated from the total awarded for the GSoC slot by Google, minus 10% (as all Sugar Labs income is donated to Software Freedom Conservancy for organisational services), minus 5% (retained for Sugar Labs General Funds),  divided by the number of mentors for the project. For example, in a year with 6 slots and 10 mentors at $500, the total revenue is $3,000; 10% for Conservancy is $300 and 5% for Sugar Labs is $150, leaving a total of $2,550 or $255 per mentor.

"Should SL be neutral about distributions containing Sugar, and refuse to endorse one over another?"
"Should 'Sugar on a Stick' be a phrase that SL asks its community to avoid using unless they refer to the SoaS-Fedora distribution?"
Any other question the Decision Panel deems required to provide an answer to the original question:"Is the current SoaS going to be the primary way Sugar Labs distributes a Sugar-centric GNU/Linux distribution?"
