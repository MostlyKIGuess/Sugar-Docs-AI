URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Goals/2018_Submissions/connection_with_Sugar_Labs_deployments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal
Establish connection with Sugarlabs deployments and obtain information on how Sugar is used, its strengths and weeknesses, and innovations developed by these deployments. Sugar has been deployed for nearly a decade and yet there is vritually no information on its use or how its users have developed from this constructive start as they reach maturity.
Suggested Timeframe
Several months - but the activity should be ongoing.
Suggested Collaborators
To date, OLPC SF is the only organization showing interest in active deployments.
