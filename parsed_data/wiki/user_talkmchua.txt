SO AS to say
Whenever the wiki talks about "SOAS installation" it means "burning an iso image to a key".  People who have never booted a machine from a USB key won't understand this, and will want to know how to 'install' or 'run' Sugar once they have their key...   a page on "how to run SOAS" would be handy.
