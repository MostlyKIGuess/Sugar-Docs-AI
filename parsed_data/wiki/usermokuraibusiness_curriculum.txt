It is traditional for secondary school students to take part-time jobs, either to help the family or to have spending money of their own. In developing countries there may be no local jobs for students, so we will need programs in the manner of Junior Achievement to help students create their own businesses and hire each other. In our case, students should prepare for
international business
through
linking schools
, and they should also have specific training for opportunities that we see developing, including e-commerce and IT outsourcing among others. They should also learn how to identify a business opportunity, and how to learn the skills that such an opportunity requires.
