Software Testing
See

.
Please keep notes on which version of Sugar on a Stick you have downloaded when reporting issues. You can refer to the name of the .iso file from the download source.
Fedora's boot menu
When booting SoaS, you'll see for a short time a Fedora screen showing a blue solar system.
By pressing the keyboard 'Escape' key here, you can get to Fedora's boot menu.
There, you should find the images name in the following structure:
Soas{version number}-{date of creation}
Pressing 'Tab' key from the boot menu will reveal the bootstrap command line. Removing the final command line parameter, 'rhgb' (RedHat graphical boot) using backspace and pressing the 'Enter' key will result in diagnostic messages being displayed on your console. Removing the 'quiet' parameter will print even more detailed messages.
Sugar version
To find out which version of the Sugar component you are using, you can look it up in the 'About my Computer' Section in 'My Settings'.
