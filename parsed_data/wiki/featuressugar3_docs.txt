Example Docstring
Let's just use google style doc strings, they are very clean and similar to the current style.
Longer example.
# GPLv3...
'''
The module does something which should be summarised here.

Example:
    Something representitive of the overall module::

        from example import ClassyClass

        # Explain non-obvious behaviour
        c = ClassyClass(a=1, b=2)
        c.props.c = 3
        c.thing()

STABLE.
'''

from gi.repository import GObject


class ClassyClass(GObject.GObject):
    '''
    The ClassyClass does blah, blah.  Explain common usage pattern of
    this class, such as calling the `thing` function to do a thing.

    The `lol` signal is emitted when the class is laughing or when a
    different non-obvious condition happens.

    Args:
        a (int): description of a
        b (int): b could be a contrustor argument or a GObject props
            that you can invoke using the **kwargs
        c (int): desctiption of c
        d (:class:`sugar3.graphics.alert.Alert`): remember to link
            classes using the correct syntax

    .. code-block:: python

        c = ClassyClass()
        # This is just an example of using this class
    '''

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        GObject.GObject.__init__(self, **kwargs)

    def thing(self, happy, lol=False):
        '''
        What a description for this function!

        Args:
            happy (bool): a description for happy

        Keyword Arguments:
            lol (bool): a optional argument, explain what
                it defaults to

        Returns:
            type: explaintaion
        '''
        pass
Benefit to Sugar
This will allow developers to create activities more eaisly.  They will no longer have to look thought the source code th understand how the api works, they will instead (hopefully) have understandable docs with good working code samples.
Scope
This will require lots of changes in the docstrings.  However, no changes will be made to code that runs on users machines.
UI Design
Example docs:

http://dev.sam.today/sugar3.graphics.alert/
http://dev.sam.today/sugar3.graphics.animator/
