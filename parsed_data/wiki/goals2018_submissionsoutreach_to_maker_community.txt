Sugar Labs member and new SLOB member, Devin Ulibarri, is a member of Artisan's Asylum (also known as A^2) in Somerville, MA.
Just some sketches...
How might we utilize this connection?
They are interested in partnering with local schools to teach Music Blocks, for example.
There are many wonderful people here who may have ideas we can use (perhaps a "hackathon" at A^2)
They are interested in having someone speak during their monthly "speakers series" (they have a preference for Wednesday evenings, which makes it difficult for Devin to help out on the ground, fyi)
Devin has a space at A^2 as well. Happy to hand out stickers at my space or during events.
