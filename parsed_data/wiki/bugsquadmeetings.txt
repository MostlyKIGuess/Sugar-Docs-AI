Soas Testing day build
(This is the
latest soas nightly build
. At the moment starting activities is broken in that build. As this is a daily snapshot it will not be fixed in time for the meeting, hence use the build from the link above.)
Testing
Some call it failure testing some stress testing. We want to meet next Wednesday to find the bugs left in Sucrose 0.84 to be able to fix them for 0.85.1 We will use the latest Sugar on a Stick for those efforts. Please watch here for announcements.
Triaging
I still wonder how we can handle the Soas component in trac best. We would need different versions and milestones for each component. We could add things like: ‘Sucrose 0.84′, ‘Soas-1′… But this would not be optimal. Idealy, when we have a ticket in the component Soas we would only have the milestones available to select which belongs to that component. If anyone knows how to do that in trac - please comment.
See
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFaq#can-i-manage-multiple-projects-from-a-single-installation-of-trac
and
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracMultipleProjects
We have been started last week to give a
homework
assignment from Trac. This week we want to verify the Soas bugs. Do they belong into this component? Or do they describe a bug that is actually in one of the Sucrose components? Do we have enough information from the reporter? Is the severity set correctly? And of course the favorite one - is it a duplicate?
