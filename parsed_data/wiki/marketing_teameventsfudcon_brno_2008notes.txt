Notes
Telling stories
telling awesome stories to demonstrate the possibilities enabled by Sugar
Pentagram's help in designing the interface
feedback process (once it's actually done)
Sugar as a
playground for innovation and experimentation
(an inspiring comment Tomeu made during Q&A)
two committees we should consider adding:
propaganda (ChristophD has been suggested for that role)
outreach
university/students liason
educators
TO-DOs
find logo
finding out who owns the rights to "Sugar" and "Sugar Labs"
=> we have to own the Sugar Labs brand and related entities
have an organizational roadmap, not just a software roadmap
set up feedback process
make sure to follow-up on projects
clean up wiki
next release in 6-months should have the biggest holes fixed
get an extra or two developers working on Sugar for 4 to 6 months
testing: outsource it to organizations (ChristophD will talk to people at universities in Graz, Austria on September 21/22 so let's see what happens); requires strong leadership (!); Gnome bug-days as an example; push for automated testing
emphasis on the importance of responding to bug-reports, even though we don't necessarily have to fix them
understanding how community works -> make it better at Sugar Labs (find quick wins, proof-points)
GdK: "simplify and amplify"
responsibilities
Sugar Labs Ambassadors (?)
weekly updates to walter, but also try to spread to more publications (e.g. Sugar ported to Beagle board @ linuxdevices.com)
focus on work planned for next week
@IAEP: media liason to spread the story
engage community via IAEP and Sugar to harness people
IRC: weekly Sugar Labs meeting, infrequent Board meetings for high-level and sensitive issues such as business, hiring, etc., board meetings open to everyone - patches welcome, candidates have to keep motivated; not only board members can run committees but board holds people accountable
set up Ministry of Propaganda / Outreach / Truth
IRL meetings: e.g. FUDCon Boston
