What is
not
in the OLPC mission?
OLPC has decided to focus its attention on creating and delivering the laptop hardware, while Sugar Labs concentrates on extending and improving Sugar education software, and making it available on other platforms.
Earth Treasury has decided to tackle all of the remaining issues.

There are also issues nominally in scope that OLPC management has neglected. This includes
Teacher training
Organizing
