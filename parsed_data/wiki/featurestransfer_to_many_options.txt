TEST-CASES THAT NEED TO PASS
Basic Usage
This feature helps share Journal/Documents/Mounted-Drives' entries across XOs, via the following two mechanismsÂ ::
Peer-to-Peer mode
Sharing in this mode is possible, only when the server and client XO(s) are on the same networks. Thus, peer-to-peer sharing would work on
XOs connected to the same Access Point.
Adhoc-Network connections.
Via-School-Server mode
In this mode, an XO uploads an entry to the central School Server; from where the client XO(s) may download the entry.
This mode of sharing works as long as the School-Server is HTTP-pingable between the server and client XOs. Thus, this mode of sharing would work when
XOs are connected to the same Access Point (as long as school-server is pingable throughout).
XOs are connected to the different Access Points (as long as school-server is pingable throughout).
XOs are conencted to Adhoc-Network (as long as school-server is pingable throughout).

Initial Proposal for the solution based on WebDAV.

Showed why simply accessing the webdav shares via "Browse" activity won't work.
The reason is that accessing Sugar-WebDAV shares via "Browse" (or in any browser), would show only the availability of files. But a Sugar-entry is more than just the (data) file; it is a combination of
Metadata-file
Data-file
Preview-file (optional)
Also, the current workflow conforms to the sugar look-and-feel too. (Thanks again Anish).

Feedback on the "peer-to-peer" mechanism; now when the user clicks "Access Share", the user is directly taken to the newly mounted remote-share view.

Example Workflow for Peer-To-Peer Mode
NOTES
An entry present in "Local Shares", is available to other peers, when the peer(s) mount this XO's shares.
Note that the entries present in "Local Shares", have nothing to do with the entries present in "School Server Shares".
In the following screenshots' example, "PEER 2" mounts the shares of "PEER 1"; and uses that to copy entries onto its own XO. Thus, the entry is copied from XO-of-PEER-1 to XO-of-PEER-2.
SCREENSHOTS
[PEER 1] "Journal" - View.
[PEER 1] Detail view of the journal-entry. Note the preview presence.
[PEER 1] Initial "Local Shares" View
[PEER 1] Copy the journal entry to "Local Shares", to make it available for sharing to other peers.
[PEER 1] "Local Shares" view, after copying the entry.
[PEER 1] The detail view in "Local Shares". NOTE that the preview MUST be present, and it must be same as that of "Journal".
[PEER 2] Initial "Journal" - View.
[PEER 2] Neighborhood View.
[PEER 2] Click on "Access Share" of the peer, whose shares need to be accessed.
[PEER 2] The peer's shares are mounted.
[PEER 2] Copy the entry to the journal.
[PEER 2] Final "Journal" View.
[PEER 2] Detail-view of the entry. Note that the preview is the same as was on the remote peer.
Example Workflow for Via-School-Server Mode
NOTES
An entry present in "School Server Shares", is available to all the XOs. There isn't any mounting or anything required as such.
Note that the entries present in "School Server Shares", have nothing to do with the entries present in "Local Shares".
In the following screenshots' example, an XO uploads an entry to the school-server, and then downloads the same. HOWEVER, NOTE THAT ANY XO WOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE ENTRY PRESENT ON THE SCHOOL-SERVER, AND NOT ONLY NECESSARILY THE UPLOADER.
SCREENSHOTS
[UPLOAD] Initially, no entries are present on the school-server.
[UPLOAD] Choose an entry to upload to the school-server.
[UPLOAD] Enter the pasphrase when prompted.
[UPLOAD] After uploading, ensure that the entry has in fact been uploaded to the school-server.
[DOWNLOAD] Initial "Documents" view.
[DOWNLOAD] Choose to copy the entry from school-server, to "Documents".
[DOWNLOAD] Enter (incorrect) password.
[DOWNLOAD] 'Passphrase not match' error occurs.
[DOWNLOAD] Try copying again.

[DOWNLOAD] Ensure that in the detail view, the uploader-details are present.
TEST-CASES THAT NEED TO PASS
Inter-copying an entry between Journal/Documents/Mounted-Drives/Local-Shares/School-Server-Shares should behave in the same way. For eg, in the peer-to-peer mode, it was shown that the source-entry (on PEER-1) had a preview; the same was true when the entry finally arrived on PEER-2. In particular, the preview should "go along" as and when the entry goes,
intra-XO
or
inter-XO
.
Things should work fine, irrespective of the fact that whether the sharing is done via single-mode, or batch-mode.
