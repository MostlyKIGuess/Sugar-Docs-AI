"Believe those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it; doubt all, but do not doubt yourself."

It has been a very exciting week. (You may have noticed, I don't often use adverbs, but
very
was called for given all that has happened this week.)
1. Simon Schampijer announced the release of
Sugar 0.98
. This is a major milestone for Sugar Labs as it is the first release that takes touch seriously. It also incorporates many improvements to the GTK3 port. The Sugar Developer Team deserves a resounding celebratory cheer of thanks for a their effort. (Note that OLPC has been incorporating Sugar 0.98 in their 13.1 series of builds, available for download here
[1]
to run on XO hardware.)
2. Google Code-In
[2]
began on Monday. We have 22 mentors
[3]
, 40 students
[4]
, and 79 out of 132 tasks already completed
[5]
. (More tasks are coming on-line soon.) The contest runs for 6 weeks, so it is not too late to
sign up as a mentor
and to
recruit students to participate
. Some highlights include new tutorials for Turtle Art, using Sugar in a Virtual Machine, and using Sugar on a Stick; a new feature: load a background image on the home screen; and numerous patches in support of internationalization. Some of the usual suspects are making their usual outstanding contributions, while some new talent is also emerging. Thanks to everyone (mentors, students, and Google) for participating.
3. Sugar Labs is holding its annual election to the oversight board early next month. If you are interested in running for one of the open board seats, open to any community member, please contact me or the membership committee with any questions *before* 7 December.
