Background
Screencast is a video screen capture utility. It is based on
Recordmydesktop
by John Varouhakis. It captures the screen to a video file which is in Ogg-Theora-Vorbis file format.
Where to get it
It can be downloaded from:
http://activities.sugarlabs.org/addon/4447
Code:
http://git.sugarlabs.org/screencast
Status
It is on it's first version on the sugar library. 
Testing and bugs welcomed.
Comments
It is thought to be buggy but the following patch has allowed video to be saved to the Journal. Open Terminal and change to directory /home/olpc/Activities/Screencast.activity and replace the file pippy_app.py with
this file
(renamed to pippy_app.py)
(it would be a good idea to backup the existing file first, eg mv pippy_app.py pippy_app.bak)
(help on replacing the file

Running from the command line
Just download as above, you dont need to patch it. Open Terminal and change to directory /home/olpc/Activities/Screencast.activity and start the recordmydesktop program from the command line.
cd Activities/Screencast.activity
  ./recordmydesktop
press ctrl c to terminate recording, wait for processing to complete and then copy the video to the journal
copy-to-journal out.ogv -m video/ogg
The video is now saved in the journal and can be played by clicking on it.
The
manual
is helpful reading.
(The meaning of the -m flag is to set the Mime type
