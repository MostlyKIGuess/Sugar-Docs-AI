Introduction
The Write activity serves as the basic text editing tool in Sugar. Its simple interface provides an easy starting point for children, presenting tools that make writing a story, poem or essay simple and straightforward. It also supports basic tools for inserting images, creating tables, and performing basic layout operations as children begin to require some of these features often associated with word processors.

What's new for users
Write has been converted to the new toolbar design. Along with this change, a number of previously menu driven functions have been separated out as new toolbar buttons for easier access.
