Activities and Procedures
Classroom Application
Grade Level = 4
This game will be used to assist with math topics taught in the classroom and will be excellent reinforcement material.
Standards Addressed
This game covers elements of the fourth grade math curriculum currently in use at Boston, MA, USA. For the complete listing, visit
Full Curriculum Framework
.
The following topics are covered in this game activity.
Implemented Curriculum Framework
NUMBER SENSE AND OPERATIONS
4.N.3
Demonstrate an understanding of fractions as parts of unit wholes, as parts of a collection, and as locations on the number line.
4.N.4
Select, use, and explain models to relate common fractions and mixed numbers (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10, 1/12, and 11/2), find equivalent fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals, and order fractions.
4.N.5
Identify and generate equivalent forms of common decimals and fractions less than one whole (halves, quarters, fifths, and tenths).
4.N.6
Exhibit an understanding of the base ten number system by reading, naming, and writing decimals between 0 and 1 up to the hundredths.
4.N.9
Select, use, and explain the commutative, associative, and identity properties of operations on whole numbers in problem situations, e.g., 37 x 46 = 46 x 37, (5 x 7) x 2 = 5 x (7 x 2).
4.N.11
Know multiplication facts through 12 x 12 and related division facts. Use these facts to solve related multiplication problems and compute related problems, e.g., 3 x 5 is related to 30 x 50, 300 x 5, and 30 x 500.
4.N.12
Add and subtract (up to five-digit numbers) and multiply (up to three digits by two digits) accurately and efficiently.
4.N.14
Demonstrate in the classroom an understanding of and the ability to use the conventional algorithms for addition and subtraction (up to five-digit numbers), and multiplication (up to three digits by two digits).
GEOMETRY
4.G.1
Compare and analyze attributes and other features (e.g., number of sides, faces, corners, right angles, diagonals, and symmetry) of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes.
4.G.3
Recognize similar figures.
4.G.4
Identify angles as acute, right, or obtuse.
4.G.7
Describe and apply techniques such as reflections (flips), rotations (turns), and translations (slides) for determining if two shapes are congruent.
4.G.9
Predict and validate the results of partitioning, folding, and combining two- and three-dimensional shapes.
MEASUREMENT
4.M.2
Carry out simple unit conversions within a system of measurement, e.g., hours to minutes, cents to dollars, yards to feet or inches, etc.

Instruction
Fortune Hunter has begun to adapt the game play for classroom use. Instead of the originally-intended method of controlling the content the player will face during his or her journey throughout the game's story, we decided it's better to just provide a "
Training Mode
". For use inside the classroom, please follow this easy lesson plan instruction.
1. Every player can power on their XO and launch Fortune Hunter.
2. Instruct students to navigate to and select Training Mode.
3. Instruct students to select Options and have them change them as desired. The options can always be changed prior to launching a game. The game will also save the latest options set and skipping this step from now on will keep these same options in effect.
4. Instruct students to select the type of training mode, Endless-Merchant or Endless-Battle. Students will earn extra money or rewards for their profile in the single player campaign based on their progress of these training types.
5. While students play, you will be able to view their overall progress on topics and accumulate information on the class.
Rationale
The purpose of the game is to promote math education through the use of fun and interactive game software. The game will be designed to teach students to use their math skills in a non-workbook setting.
