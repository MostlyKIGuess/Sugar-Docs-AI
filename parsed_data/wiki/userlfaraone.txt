About me
See my
wikipedia page
, and my
OLPC wikipage
.
I'm a student and developer based out of Washington, DC. I've been working with Sugar for 2 years, and Linux in general for 6+ years. Prior to joining Sugar Labs, I worked with
OLPC
in the
Support Gang
to handle "donor relations", essentially replying to support tickets as well as gathering user feedback about the OLPC and Sugar experience.
Things I do at Sugar Labs
I help maintain a number of Sugar Labs web services along with
Bernie Innocenti
such as
Gitorious
,
Infrastructure Team/Resources#Sunjammer
, and
Google Apps
. I am also an
administrator
and
bureaucrat
at the Sugar Labs Wiki. I have
founder access
to the
#sugar
and
#sugar-meeting
channels, so if you need assistance with any of those services feel free to
ask me
.
I try to help out where I can with software development and design. I'm currently working on improving the user experience for the installation and deployment of
Sugar on a Stick
for both educators and students.
