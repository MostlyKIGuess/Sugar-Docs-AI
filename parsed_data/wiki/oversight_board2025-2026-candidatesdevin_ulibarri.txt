Vision and Goals
I believe in Sugar Labs's mission, and I believe strongly that educators and students need an organization like Sugar Labs, which both offers software for learning as well as mentorship and community. In addition to this, its commitment to software freedom offers incredible value for education, since FLO allows for a pathway from "user" to "contributor" that proprietary platforms inherently cannot.
That said, there are some basic organizational pillars that we need to fortify in order to truly realize our potential. Any functional organization needs: governance, management, finances, and administrative systems. All of these pillars must be strong to properly support our programs, which ultimately serve the organization's mission. (See

As I see it, the biggest hurdle that Sugar Labs faces in leading in its mission is to strengthen its governance, management, finances, and administrative systems. This is necessary because, in order to take on new projects, maintain old ones, and expand our programs, we need increased capacity.
I envision a Sugar Labs that has several full-time staff who, while not hindering the influx of volunteer and student contributions, are able to take the ultimate responsibility for long-term maintenance of systems, educational software, and community programs. Achieving this stabilization of our projects and programs should increase our capacity to take on more, and, having submitted several grant applications, I know that funders--whether foundations or individuals--are often looking for a higher level of organizational maturity before committing their funding.
