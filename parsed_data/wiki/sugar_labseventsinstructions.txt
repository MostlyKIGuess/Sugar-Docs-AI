Instructions for adding an event to the Sugar Labs Calendars
Sign in to
http://mail.sugarlabs.org
Click on the Calendar link on the top link bar
This will open yourAccount@sugarlabs.org calendar (a personal calendar)
Click the 'Settings' link in the top right link bar
Make sure that the timezone is set for your personal location
Click 'Save' at the bottom of this settings page, and then '<< Back to Calendar'
The
Sugar Labs Events
calendar should show in the 'My Calendars' list in the left sidebar
If not, select the 'Add by URL' from the 'Other Calendars'>'Add' menu in the sidebar.
Enter

calendar

Click on the calendar day for the new meeting or event.
Enter a short title for the event
Click on the 'Edit event details >>' link shown in red
Uncheck 'All day' to set the time. Use your timezone (set in step 2 above). The calendar is set to display on the wiki site with UTC times, but will display your timezone when you are logged in to this calendar.
Enter an irc channel for 'Where', such as
irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar-meeting
Enter a mailing list, such as sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org, or individual email addresses in the Guests list box
Enter a description for the meeting in the Description text box.  Links may also be entered.
Defaults are fine for everything else
Click 'Save', and then 'Send' on the Send Invitations dialog
Modifying an Event
Recurring events, such as regular team meetings, are saved as a single sequenced event, so modifying a single event to add an agenda or to change the time will create a new event to replace the one chosen in the sequence.  (On saving a change, one is given the option to also modify all events, [the sequence], or subsequent events only.)
An event change announcement sent by Google Calendar seems to be labeled with the timezone formatting of the calendar of the change user, so to avoid confusion on timezones, at this point, it would be best to change your personal timezone setting to UTC before updating a Sugar Labs Meeting or Event calendar event.
When you view the event in your personal Gmail calendar, it will show times according to the personal timezone setting.
