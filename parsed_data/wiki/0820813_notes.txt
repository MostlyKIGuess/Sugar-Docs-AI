Sucrose 0.81.3
Announcement
The release has several cool new features. Manual reordering of the Home icons and a freeform layout, improved feedback on activity startup, support for custom certificates in Browse, alt+tab activity switching, just to cite some. We are now in feature freeze and the focus will switch on testing, bug triaging and fixes. I'm proud to say that we achieved practically all the features that we had targeted, I want to thanks everyone that made this possible.
