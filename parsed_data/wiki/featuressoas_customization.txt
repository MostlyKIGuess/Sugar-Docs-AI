Summary
SOAS Deployment Customization
Owner

Current status
Targeted release: (0.88)
Last updated: (2009 Nov 24)
Percentage of completion: 5%
Detailed Description
In order to support deployments activities the standard SOAS image should allow a limited degree of customization for basic/advanced settings.
This page would be the start of a documentation effort aimed to document those basic interfaces:
Benefit to Sugar
to ease the personalization efforts from field organizations
to avoid regression issues related to personalization done in the wrong places
to ease peacefully coexistence between personalization needs and bug fixing/support activities
Scope
Actually will be mostly a documentation effort - no impact on code in this phase.
How To Test
Features/SoaS customization/Testing
User Experience
In case of a deploy in a school we could not expect children or teacher to spend a large initial amount of time to set up basic parameters for SOAS usage (es. LANGUAGE, Timezone, Keyboard, servers, etc).
Whatever approach would be taken in order to land those initial settings in the actual sticks/images, the very first step is to try to define with increasing detail:
what  all those settings are
where a deployer or developer could find them
how to operate changes to those setting without creating regression errors in the procedure
Dependencies
None on code
Once consensus being reached on the customization documentation, developers that changes Sugar in areas that impact this documentation set should fell obliged to update it consistently and notify downstream.
Contingency Plan
If we don't complete this feature, it can be left out. Nothing else depends upon it.

Note: The "Complexity" column could be the base for differentiate the effort/scope of personalization effort:
some of them could be defined as "standard" and potentially we could have half baked tools to smooth efforts (the idea is that's far easier to write a well done & safe script to be used by deployer on the field other than  increase the Sugar UI with rarely used features)
some of them could be defined as "hard" and then documented only then left to field/deployers will...
