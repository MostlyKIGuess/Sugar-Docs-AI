This small school is in a very isolated region 2 hours drive south from Puno. I was very impressed by the tremendous work done by the teachers with the XO even though they had received very little training.
In Lacachi, children of all grades take the laptops home every day and use them while helping their parents to look after the animals. The teachers said that, without a working repair service, the incentive is to keep the laptops secured in boxes and use them occasionally, like the nearby schools do.
These are my raw notes from the visit:
Lacachi
Laptops: 40 XO-1
Software: Sugar 0.84 with few activities
Internet: no
Electricity: good wiring, but they have frequent blackouts
Child ownership: yes (grades 1-6, last year only grades 3-6)
Broken laptops: 4 (screen, keyboard, battery). They're not sending them out for repair because they are never returned.
Problems reported by teachers: touchpads (they have 10 mouses), no curriculum, keys come off
Laptop use in school: 0.5-1h per day
Laptop use at home: 1-2h (they use laptops also when they're looking after cows and sheep)
