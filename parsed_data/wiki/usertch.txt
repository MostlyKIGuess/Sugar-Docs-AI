Martin Abente Lahaye
I finished the engineering school at the Catholic University of Asunción on December 2008, since January 2009 to October 2010 I worked as the Chief of the development department in Paraguay's OLPC deployment, also worked as full time developer for Dextrose with the Activity Central crew until mid 2011. After a year-break doing a master degree at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, I am back to Paraguay promoting Sugar and open source development at the Polytechnic University of Asunción.
