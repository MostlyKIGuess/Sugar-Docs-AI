Sugar Digest
1. Our release manager, Martin Abente, has announced the release of Sugar 0.107.2 (unstable). With this release, we have frozen API, UI and Strings for Sugar 0.108. The focus now is on translations and testing.
The most notable change in this release is that Sugar Collaboration works on newer systems (e.g. Fedora 23).
The tarballs can be downloaded from:
sugar-0.107.2.tar.xz
sugar-toolkit-gtk3-0.107.2.tar.xz
sugar-artwork-0.107.2.tar.xz
sugar-datastore-0.107.2.tar.xz
sugar-runner-0.107.2.tar.xz
Tip of the hat to the developer team, Sam Parkinson, Nick DeFilippis and the Google Code-In students for their contributions, and to James Cameron and Gonzalo Odiard for their thorough reviewing work. And to Martin for overseeing the release process.

Google Code-in
ends today. A remarkable 358 tasks have been completed by 145 students, supervised by a team of 24 mentors. (By comparison, 60 students completed tasks last year, so we more than doubled the rate of participation.)
The mentor team will be reviewing the work of our top ten finalists to decide on two grand prize winners who will travel to Google with their parents. The top ten are: Ezequiel Pereira, Daksh Shah, Cristian, Boquete, ndefilippis, Shrix, Manveer_B, Hrishi, Sanskar Jindal, and Jas Park. Between them, they completed 177 tasks.
It is worth mentioning in light of the pending release of Sugar 0.108 that, among other things, the GCI students updated a number of Sugar activities such that they will work with the new Collaboration Wrapper. They also fixed dozens of activities that were not working due to changes in dependencies, incompatible binaries, etc.
