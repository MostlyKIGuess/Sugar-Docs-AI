Introduction of the new board
We thanked Chris, Sebastian, and Aleksey for their numerous contributions to Sugar and the Sugar oversight board. We also thanked Luke for once again running the election.
Finances
Robert Fadel created a summary (included below) of our 2012 financial position.  Software Freedom Conservancy noted after the meeting that these financial detials are an unaudited draft financial document for CY 2012, and that Conservancy's FY is from Feb-March, which doesn't match the calendar year.

Discussion of ideas for 2013
a global Sugar meeting for 2013
more Sugar Camps (with some travel subsidies for developers and teachers and
children
)
we are going to have a Sugar Camp early next month in the Bay Area... it will be small and focused... I think on cloud integration, but the theme is not completely firm
promoting Sugar with educators...
online chats to build community with teachers...
ClaudiaU: we can ask our educators in countries to invite at least one teacher....
GeraldA: I can invite some teachers as well.
take advantage of the wealth of Sugar hackers in .UY to start a bottom-up shake up of the use of computers in the schools
if each hacker identified a couple of willing teachers, we could make a lot happen
Turtle Art Day
sdanielf: just an idea, let's follow a Turtle Art Day from all the countries
ClaudiaU: I think TA would be one way to have fun.... 1) thinking about how to support (materials, online chat, local workshops, etc) and 2) how to show everyone's work...
In May, we will be releasing Sugar 1.0; some event around that release?
Evangelize about the Sugar evaluation tools
Actions
: ClaudiaU agreed to share
Making Learning Visible
with SLOB members (and Tonyf and JT4Sugar)
Odds and ends
We have a private mailing list for slobs but the convention is to CC iaep unless there is a reason for privacy... it is more a convenience and archive than back channel
All the meeting notes are logged in the wiki (as well as in the
meeting logger
)
There is a
Fiscal Agreement
all SLOB members need to file with the SFC
We tend to meet both on a regular schedule and on demand... but early in the year, it is good to meet more often
Please do not be shy about bringing up topics, asking questions, challenging assumptions and the status quo
