Overview
Colors is a simple natural media painting activity for the XO laptop, based on a Nintendo DS program by Jens Andersson.
Rather than constructing images from geometric shapes, the user is encouraged to keep painting on their work until it looks right, starting with rough strokes and then adding extra details.
The activity features soft brushes, collaborative painting, the ability to watch tutorial paintings as they are painted, and a variety of input methods including "video paint" using the webcam.
Setting up a Wacom tablet
Colors! versions 11 and above support USB Wacom tablets, such as the
Wacom Bamboo
($60 at Amazon).
On OLPC XO-1
Wacom support requires OLPC Software Release 8.2.0, so update if you are on an older build.
To use your USB Wacom tablet with Colors, you need to do a little work at the Terminal.
wget
http://dev.laptop.org/~wadeb/setupwacom.sh
sudo sh setupwacom.sh
This will install the linuxwacom package, download and install the Wacom kernel module, and download and replace your Xorg configuration file with one that supports Wacom tablets.
Restart your XO and launch Colors!.  Voila, Wacom support!  Check the Sensitive buttons in the Brush Control screen to enable pressure sensitivity for brush size and opacity.
