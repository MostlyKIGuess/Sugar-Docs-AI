--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Sugar has made inroads around the world: more than three million users. But chances are, it is not being used at your local elementary school. Instead, they are likely using expensive, proprietary software for "gamified" worksheets and babysitting. Most likely because they don't know any better.
Task
Introduce Sugar to your local school administrator. Help craft a Sugar deployment plan.
