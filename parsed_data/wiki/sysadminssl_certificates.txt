Title: Sysadmin/SSL Certificates
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sysadmin/SSL_Certificates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use StartCom's StartSSL for our certificates.
Generate a key and a CSR: (we use
-batch
because StartSSL ignores everything but the public key in the CSR)
openssl req -batch -new -keyout CNAME.sugarlabs.org.key -out CNAME.sugarlabs.org.csr
Log into the
StartSSL control panel
.
If you need to reconfirm access to the Sugar Labs domain (which is required every 30 days), do the following:
Go to "Validation Wizard"
Select **Type**: "Domain Name Validation"
Choose the validation email for which you have access to. These all go to a RT queue, so you'll need RT permissions to receive these emails.
Retrieve the authentication code from RT and enter it into the StartSSL site.
Go to "Certificate Wizard"
Select "Web Server" as the certificate type
Skip "Generate Private Key", we already generated one on our own hardware.
Paste in your CSR into the textarea.
Select "sugarlabs.org" as the domain
Enter the subdomain for which you are requesting access
Your certificate will either be granted instantly, or sometime over the next three hours. You'll get an email notification when that happens, and will be able to retrieve the certificate from *Tool box > Retrieve Certificate*.
Use the
SSL validator
to verify the new certificate and web server configuration (NOTE: the validator doesn't seem to support SNI).
