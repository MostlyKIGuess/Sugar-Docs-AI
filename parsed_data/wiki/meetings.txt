Meeting bot
An instance of the old
meetbot
(eggdrop based), run by
dogi
and
alsroot
, lives in the #sugar-meeting channel. See the
link
for more detailed instructions, but you should be able to get by if you just say "#startmeeting" (no quotes) at the start of the meeting, and "#endmeeting" (no quotes) at the end of the meeting. This will cause meeting logs to automatically be generated and posted at
http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/
Meeting pages
See
Category:Meetings
for the meeting pages of the various Sugar Labs teams and projects.
