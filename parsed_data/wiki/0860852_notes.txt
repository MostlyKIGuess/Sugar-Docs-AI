Sucrose 0.85.2 Release Notes
Announcement
This is the second development release in the 0.86 release cycle - see the
0.86/Roadmap#Schedule
for more details. Note, that we are two weeks late with this release, as we wanted to land some of the features so we can get feedback on, especially the toolbar redesign. This will have no effect on the final release date.
We are getting closer to the feature freeze and a few features have been landed in this release. Please test them carefully and report any bug and workflow issues you find to get them in good shape for the release. A friendly
BugSquad
will be available to triage those bugs accordingly and the developers can never have enough bug food. If you have non-bug feedback about features you can use the sugar-devel mailing list to share it with us.
From a user point of view we want to highlight the following changes that have been made:
Switch to Metacity window manager
Sugar
switches
the window manager from Matchbox to Metacity. Matchbox is designed for small devices that run all applications maximized. Sugar can run in devices with bigger screens and some applications break when run in Matchbox. Using Metacity instead means that some unsugarized apps would run better inside Sugar and that Sugar activities would behave better when run outside Sugar.
Flash Activities
Gnash has been added to the Sugar Platform, meaning that authors of educative content can use
Flash tools to create activities
for Sugar.
Activity Toolbar redesign
The activity toolbar has been redesigned, since the design of using tabs to group options, an activity can have, did not turn out to work so well. More details about the
Features/New Toolbar Design
. The redesign gives a solution for the "stop activity issue" pointed out in
#452
. Browse and Write have been ported to use the new Toolbar design.
Tabs in Browse
Links that would open in a new window now open in new tabs inside the main activity window similar to the behavior in other browsers. Though this
feature
isn't proposing any way for the user to explicitly open any link in a new tab, or explicitly create a new tab.
Ad hoc Networking
The new ad hoc networking facilities allows users to connect with each other over wireless in an ad hoc manner without infrastructure like an Access Point. This is the so called under a tree scenario. OLPC provided that functionality based on hardware mesh. This
feature
allows to provide that functionality with nearly all the wireless hardware. Furthermore it allows you to do share an internet connection using the same mechanism.
Read
The read activity does support now Epub files. For getting epubs,
http://www.feedbooks.com
and
http://www.epubbooks.com/
can be recommended. Furthermore this version will let you associate (add and edit) notes with your bookmarks, and has a slightly more useful fullscreen view (you can now get a rough idea of how much battery is left in your laptop/netbook without invoking the frame).
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
There are no known compatibility issues, as of today.
Update to this version
Please use the instructions for your distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian etc) of choice to upgrade to this release.

What is new for packagers
Metacity:
The switch to
Metacity

python bindings
>= 0.2

Distributions need to package the last version of Gnash (v9).
Tabs in Browse:
Hulahop version >= 0.5
Write:
Abiword 2.8 is close to be released and will be part of the Sugar Platform 0.86, so we need to have the latest release in the 2.7.x series packaged so we start testing it.
