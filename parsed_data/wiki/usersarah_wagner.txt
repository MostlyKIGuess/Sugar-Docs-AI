Hi. My name is Sarah Wagner. I am in my 4th year at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am a double major in Information Technology and Psychology and am minoring in Computer Science and plan to graduate in May 2012.
This quarter I will be working on Lemonade Stand as a part of the Humanitarian Open Source Software class at RIT.
