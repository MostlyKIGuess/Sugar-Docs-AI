Goals
Our goal is to improve the journal usability adding new features and extensions.
Objectives
Use the new toolbar.
Enable multiple files operations.
Use tags.
New toolbar
The current journal toolbar ran out of space for new options. The new toolbar provides the structure we require for adding these new GUI elements.
Filter and Sort sub-toolbar
The current toolbar will be completely moved to a new sub-toolbar. Since this sub-toolbar is not always visible we also add a new element to the journal GUI that pretends to display current [filters, sorting criterias, tags] at any time.
Multiple files operations
Add a checkbox column to every journal entry.
Display the edit sub-toolbar when more than one entry is selected.
Allowed Operations for multiple files
Copy
Send to
Remove (this operation should display a warning before committing)
All of this operations should display a proper progress bar.
Tags
In this work we propose to remove the current star icon and replace it by tags. We propose to add a new sub-toolbar to manage the creation and deletion of tags. These tags could be used by dragging tags and dropping them on the journal entry.
