HTML5 activities
NEW 04/30/2013
Because HTML5 activities generate lot of threads I must confess that I’m lost :-(
And if I’m lost, I think that it worse for students interested by this subject for the GSoC :-)
So I’ve tried to sum up everything I know about this subject on a dedicated page of the Wiki: :
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/HTML5_activities
Do not hesitate to Complete/update if I missed something, Move it if I’ve put it in a wrong place.

Hi all,
   The question about how to get videos from Khan Academy in any language was asked several times on this list.
   We planned this year to deploy offline Khan Academy videos in French to our Nosy Komba deployment. So I've worked with Bibliotheque Sans Frontiere to get French videos.
   They suggested me to use KA Lite [1], a software dedicated to install a offline Khan Academy server.
   BTW it's slightly intrusive and need some installation. So I've write a script to explore and extract only videos URL. You could find it here [2].
   The result of the script could be seen here [3] as a tree or here [4] as a single list.
   Hope it could help.
   Best regards from France. Lionel.

Flash
09/21/2013 flash on a XO
If you are using Flash you need to also install nspluginwrapper, and use it to "wrap" the plugin so WebKit can see it.
Use "yum -y install nspluginwrapper" to install the package.
The OLPC OS build scripts for custom builds use the following command (run as root or via sudo) to finish the wrapping process.  I have not verified it yet on a XO-1.5:
/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/npconfig -n -p nswrapper_32_32 -d /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins-wrapped -i /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
html5 Trial in youtube
"This is an opt-in trial of HTML5 video on YouTube."
"We support browsers that support both the video tag in HTML5 and either the h.264 video codec or the WebM format (with VP8 codec)"
Convert MediaWiki to HTML
Firefox:"Save page as-Web page-complete"
If these are saved to a USB they can be opened with a XO-1 running os883 switched to gnome desktop,
or any off-line computer running firefox browser.
This may be the simplest way to generate a HTML file for adding to the new sugar webpage (not tested)

 -H HASH, --hash=HASH  Use a specific checksum algorithm (default: sha1)
 -d, --dd              Overwrite your device with the image using dd
                       (WARNING: destructive)
Installing and using liveusb-creator in sugar
An easy method for Fedora and Windows, however this method does not generate a separate home.img filesystem to conserve the exhaustible OS overlay (see
LiveOS image
), nor does it copy the livecd-iso-to-disk installation script to the new device to permit generation of a new Live USB device from the first.
Note if graphical liveusb-creator program will not make a bootable USB stick from an .iso file:
(This can happen if the stick is formatted to fat16 on another PC with a different Operating System.)
Use terminal command :
liveusb-creator --reset-mbr
USB stick must be formatted: fat16/32; Labeled=LIVE; boot flag set.
(The LIVE label is only required when the device is to be used for a subsequent uncompressed installation to a hard disk.)
