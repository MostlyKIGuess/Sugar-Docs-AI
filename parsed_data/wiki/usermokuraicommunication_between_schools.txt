Part of the Earth Treasury mission is to link schools around the world for educational and other purposes. The ideal situation is connecting schools in which all children at both ends have their own laptops, but we can make connections even if children have time-limited access to computers.
Some educational benefits:
Meeting people from another culture
Geography lessons
Learning languages
International collaborations on education projects
Creating international organizations on children's issues, education, environmental monitoring, and much more
After such relationships are well established, students getting business training can also think about whom to go into business with.
