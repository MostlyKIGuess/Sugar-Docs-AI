Title: Talk:Features/Replace GtkMenu
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Talk:Features/Replace_GtkMenu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wanted: global hotkeys while menu shown
One of the features lost in the transition to 0.98 was use of the hotkeys while a menu palette was displayed, especially in the home, list, or journal views.
Test case: verify F1 and F3 keys work, move mouse over central icon, pause until palette is shown, verify F1 and F3 keys work; they should dismiss the palette and switch view.
Please consider restoring this lost feature. --

Is that specific to GtkMenu palettes?

Don't know.  Check the code?  I've searched for GtkMenu and not found it in sugar and sugar-toolkit-gtk3 repositories, except as a comment. --

Ok, I tested and it is not specific to GtkMenu based palettes, maybe this is a seperate fix?
BTW, GtkMenu is the C way of saying it and therefore what the Gtk docs use, python code would use Gtk.Menu

Thanks.  Best to not mention GtkMenu then, since the code is python.  Edited page.  --

Wanted: escape key to dismiss menus
There is no accelerator for dismissing Sugar menus.  Other platforms provide escape for this.  Please consider adding escape as an accelerator.  --

It is possible to fix this right now.  See
sugar-toolkit-gtk3 pull request 223

Not a feature, where is design change discussion?
Your change to replace GtkMenu does not appear to be a feature, as it provides nothing new to the Sugar user experience.  It is a minor change to the user experience, substituting a modal dialog for a submenu.  Has this change passed through the design team on sugar-devel@? --
