Erikos
Erikos is a simple "Simon Says"-inspired game where the object is to repeat a sequence of sounds played by the computer. (The name Erikos comes from the nick of Sugar maintainer Simon Schampijer.)
How to play
Hit the play button and a sequence of sounds will play. Click on the colored icons corresponding to the sound in the same order as they were played. Each round, the sequence gets longer.
