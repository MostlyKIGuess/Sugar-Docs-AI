While Bulletin-boards provide a layer of abstraction on top of any given activity, the
View Source
button allows one to look behind the activity, peeling away layers of abstraction in order to reveal the underlying codebase which makes it tick.  This feature will integrate cleanly with the
olpc:Develop
activity, encouraging children to view, modify, and redistribute variations on the activities they use.  Through collaboration and sharing, a garden of home grown activities will begin to develop on the laptops, created by the children themselves.
