Title: Service/IRC Proxy
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Service/IRC_Proxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our shell accounts server
Machine/sunjammer
hosts an instance of
BIP
,
a multiuser IRC proxy.
Requesting a proxy
This service is only available to trusted developers with a
shell account
.
Setup a password with
bipmkpw
on sunjammer and send the
resulting hash to the
sysadmin contact
along
with:
Your IRC nickname
Optionally, a list of channels to connect to
Optionally, your NickServ password so the proxy can automatically login as you when the server boots
Since you'll be connecting from one of our public IPs, we'll provide your actual
login name and real name to the IRC network.
Of course, you can have other servers besides FreeNode. Let us know which
ones you require.
Configuring your IRC client
IRC clients should be configured as follows:
Hostname: shell.sugarlabs.org
 Port: 7778
 Use SSL: yes
 Accept invalid SSL certificates: yes
 Server password: USERNAME:PASSWORD:NETWORK
BIP uses the password field to encode three fields separated by a colon:
USERNAME: your bip username (same of your shell account)
PASSWORD: the password you used with bipmkpw
NETWORK: the identifier of the IRC network to connect to (for example, "freenode").
If you have multiple IRC networks, create multiple server entries in your IRC client,
each one with a different value for NETWORK.
This configuration is known to work with
XChat
and
Konversation
.
