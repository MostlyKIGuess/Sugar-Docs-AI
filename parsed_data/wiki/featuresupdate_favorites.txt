Detailed Description
Since
Features/Multiple home views
landed in Sugar 100, it would be nice to enable user-space updates to the Home views.
This requires a new dbus service. The idea is that Sugar activities, e.g.,
Activities/Share Favorites
, could share favorites without requiring a reboot. So, for example, a teacher could share a desktop specific to a lesson plan.
Benefit to Sugar
More ways to share configuration information in the classroom or among buddies w/o requiring a reboot.
Scope
In jarabe/view/service.py
@dbus.service.method(_DBUS_SHELL_IFACE,
                         in_signature='ssb', out_signature=
)
def SetBundleFavorite(self, bundle_id, version, favorite):
        bundleregistry.get_registry().set_bundle_favorite(
            bundle_id, version, favorite)
How To Test
User Experience
The direct impact on the user will be that they don't have to reboot when receiving favorites from buddies.
Dependencies
No new dependencies
Contingency Plan
None.
