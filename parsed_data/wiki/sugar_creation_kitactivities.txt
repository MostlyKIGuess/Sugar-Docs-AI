How To remove an installed or Updated activity
This is for original activities or those updated through ControlPanel/Software-Update
Sugar terminal:
su 
(password)
cd /usr/share/sugar/activities/
ls
(note name of activity that is to be removed)
rm -rf ~ xxxxxx.activity
(Removes the activity-this is irreversible)
now an activity .xo file in the sugar journal with the same name (with a lower version number) will start
as an example: if you want to run Browse 112.xo downloaded from ASLO if Browse-120 is installed in sugar.
