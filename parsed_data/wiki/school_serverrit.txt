School Server Fall 2009 Seminar Project
Purpose
To create a school server with minimal hardware requirements in order to develop and test ideas and innovation from within the community
schoolserver.rit.edu
Note:
Admin log is located on the server at /var/log/adminlog.log
Project Ideas
Current Project and/or current main focus
Library /Book Reader
. Thousands of books stored on the XS which children are able to pull over the network either as whole book  or bit by bit as they read them on their XO's.
An e-book reader client/server system
Additionally, they can "check out" books and bring them home on their laptops to read at home, or while not connected to the XS.
This may prove to be more economical than the proposal of distributing text via SD cards as it would allow for a wider range of content per available Gigabyte. One 40 gig hard disk library would hold 10 times as much content as ten, 4-GB SD cards replicated with identical content.
Run said books through Pootle, so children have access to books not in their native tongue.
Essentially, a back-end to the read activity.
Status:
Currently under development; See "Reading Library" below.
Completed projects and tasks
File Distribution System
Status:
Completed; Testing and improvements currently under development. See more information below - "File Distribution System". Please email us at our contact address if you are interested in learning more about this portion of the XS project or are interested in assisting in development.
Fix Ejabber
Status:
Ejabber is running and working. XO's can communicate
To use Ejabber point XO server to schoolserver.rit.edu
Configure Moodle to our needs
Status:
Moodle is not configured; We currently do not have a project that needs Moodle.
Future project ideas
Provide a school server test and development environment for the Honors Seminar participants
Develop School Server systems administration skills
Backup registered XO's or Sugar Sticks
Status:
Not started
Host Moodle content developed in class
Status:
Moodle is installed but not fully configured.
Test and Debug XS - Sugar Labs School Server software
Currently running OLPC-School-Server-0.6-i386.iso
Status:
Upgraded to the latest XS Server image.
Develop a School Server SysAdmin training curriculum for volunteers who want to support OLPC, the XS Server project, or Sugar deployment
Basic documentation and support is being compiled
Status:
Under development; not complete.
Create an Activity(XO Application) for RIT XO's so students can easily access Moodle
Status:
Not started
Moodle XO Python API
Status:
Not started
XO Backup/Restore
Status:
Not started
XO Security
[1]
Status:
Not started
Deployment "whitebook"
Status:
Not started
Provide a service that allows teachers/volunteers (who do not speak English) in actual deployments to communicate via email with technical support volunteers by using the translating service
Pootle
. Incoming and outgoing "tagged" emails would be translated in and out of the server on arrival/departure of the XS.
Status:
Not started
In class quizzing. Teachers ask questions, students respond using their XO, quiz results stored on XS. (Think the
I>clicker
; Similar concepts were proposed by
Alex Jones
)
Status:
Not started
Possibility of parsing of information, possible graphical heuristics.
Status:
Not started

Proposed Design Goals
Hold copies of e-books for learners with no Internet access
Compatible with existing Sugar e-book readers
Teacher/Administrator interface for loading books from a variety of Internet book archives and portable USB or CD/DVD storage media.
In the end, we want to have instructions and some supporting scripts to modify the standard OLPC School Server to support a reading library and our campus environment as independent features.
File Distribution System
An alternative to extending e-book readers - a file distribution system for the server and a client for the XO. The goal of this project is to build an easy system to host files on the server that can be downloaded using the browser activity and possibly a file distribution download activity.
See the
Project Page for File Distribution System
.
Network Configuration
The School Server, XS, as received is designed and configured for 2 Ethernet adapters,
eth0 - connected to the Wide Area Network (WAN) or the campus Internet connection,
eth1 - connected to an Access Point (AP) which the XOs connect to.
For robustness in unreliable power supply environments, there are scripts that reconfigure features on a frequent basis. This design has frustrated anyone wanting to deviate from the default configuration.
We will have to understand the design, carefully document our adjustments for our environment, and make preparations to restore one or more configurations once we upgrade to a new version of the server that may likely restore some of the default configurations.
System Configuration
Current OS installed:
OLPC-School-Server-0.6-i386.iso
From:
http://xs-dev.laptop.org/xs/
using Martin Langhoff's explicit instructions.
System Information
All configurations based on the installing steps and configurations found at
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/School_server
and modified as needed for our applications.
Hostname:
schoolserver.rit.edu
Server uptime:
12:54:38 up 9 days, 18:50,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00
CPU model: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.80GHz
Collaboration Server
This bug report,
http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/9242
, covers the missing collaborator icons in the Neighborhood view (after first connection and before reboot or reconnection to the access point)
/etc/idmgr.conf
edited line
BIND_DOMAIN=172.18.0.1
to
BIND_DOMAIN=129.21.47.159
in order to try to enable the registration service. Ran
service idmgr restart
.
But, on trying to register my XO, it stalls for a minute or two and then reports that it failed to connect to the schoolserver (it was connected to the ejabberd service).
