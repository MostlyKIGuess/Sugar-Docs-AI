Owner
Name:
Martin Abente
Email: mabente at paraguayeduca.org
Current status
Targeted release: 0.88
Last updated: 11/01/2010
Percentage of completion: 100%
Detailed Description
An icon will be added to the frame when a modem is connected, and the user will be able to connect and disconnect from there. Also, a section will be added to the control panel that will allow entering the details needed by the connection.
Benefit to Sugar
Users will be able to access internet in more situations. This has been requested from Uruguay and Paraguay.
Scope
We'll need to add an extension for the device icon and another extension for the control panel. Also will need to modify the SettingsManager so it provides the 3G settings that NetworkManager needs.
