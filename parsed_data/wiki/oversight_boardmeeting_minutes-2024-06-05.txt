Fundraiser
Devin has been running the weekly seminar. It has been really interesting.
FWIW, we did get 20 more YT subscribers (from 100) in the past 30 days
That's a 20% increase within a month
GSoC/DMP
Look for blog posts [here](

).
In brief:
The Pippy "co-pilot" project is looking at how to include pygame and GTK toolkits in a Sugar-like way
The Maths Games projects are sorting out some issues like screen-size changes as they progress on individual games... there are 3-4 already coded but needing some additional TLC
The sing to MB project has settled in on an initial approach to pitch and rhythm tracking.
The RPi projects are focusing on Pippy, Turtle, and Measure extensions
MB4 -- working on defining the block UX
The Make-Your-Own Lesson Plan project is working with RAG on the guide data so far... lesson plan data up next.
