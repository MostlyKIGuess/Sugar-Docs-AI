Goals for 2010
Proposed 2010 goals for Sugar Labs (very rough first pass)
Release Sucrose 0.88 and 0.90 in order to provide a more useful and stable learning platform for deployments and developers
Release Sucrose 0.88 in March
Release Sucrose 0.90 in November
Deliver a product that has been well tested for usability and
accessibility
needs
Make successful launches with great marketing campaigns
Promote corresponding SoaS releases with Fedora
Define Sugar 1.0 so that we can begin partnering with long-term stable distros, such as RHEL
Make Sugar the learning platform of choice for 2010
Support existing local user groups (e.g., local Sugar Labs) and work to create new ones
Have SL representation at major free software and education events
Establish relationship with third-party solution providers to help them understand the benefits of Sugar
Work with other learning programs that complement our efforts
Explore Sugar in the context of mobile devices and web-based services
Make Sugar Labs
the
place for working on learning-related technologies
Provide forums for teachers and developers to collaborate
Provide a forum (similar to ASLO) for learners to share their work
Demonstrate leadership by providing great tools for the appropriation and application of knowledge
Always ask: how does this impact the learning
Let downstreams such as deployers and vendors lead development by providing human resources
Eat our own dogfood
Promote free software
Be transparent and open to critique
Encourage new people to join our project
It has been proposed that
rather than
in addition to (having communal goals helps individuals frame their personal goals) having overarching goals that everyone in SL runs towards for 2010, we ask everyone within the SL community to state and document (perhaps on their user page, announced to IAEP and Planet) their individual SL goals for 2010, so people can easily find areas of intersection-of-interest that would advance SL's mission - if enough people pick up on the same goal (individually), then it becomes a de facto "community goal."

5-Year Goals
ROUGH DRAFT
Given the pace of social, economic, and technological change, it is difficult predict what the context for Sugar Labs will be in 2015. However, we can frame our goals on some relatively stable tenets: 
(1) we embrace a distributed model of development and support; (2) "learning through doing" will remain our focus; and (3) and contributing to Sugar itself is part of the learning process. (Note that in 2015, Sugar's first Learners from 2007 will be in high school: a potentially large group of contributors.)
In five years:
Sugar will be the learning platform of choice (our bottom-up adoption rate by teachers and parents -- including "home-schoolers" -- will out-pace our top-down adoption rate by ministers and administrators):
We will have a stable, "proven" platform that is easily customized;
We will have well-established channels of communication with and among teachers and parents;
We will have simple, robust distribution channels.
There will be local Sugar user groups measured in the 10000s:
These groups will be providing most of the support and development of Sugar;
Sugar activities will number in the 100000s and 99% of these will have been written by teachers and children;
Sugar will be integrated into computer science and education school curricula, providing a talent pool for the local labs.
Sugar, while still being primarily a stand-alone platform, will work fluidly within the context of mobile devices and web-based services.
Sugar will remain focused on the needs of learning. (While the platform itself will be adopted and adapted for other problem spaces, the focus of the Sugar Labs community will remain: "how does this impact learning?")
We will continue to promote Free Software;
Be transparent and open to critique;
Encourage new people to join our project;
We will enable individuals to be expressive with Sugar such that they can pursue their own goals and we will have a mechanism for sharing those goals and successes.
