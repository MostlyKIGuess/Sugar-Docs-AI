--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
In Sugar we now have built-in on-screen keyboard support using
Maliit
. However, at present we only have keyboard for a small subset of the [translate.sugarlabs.org | languages we support].
Task
a) Review the list of the
Maliit keyboards now available
.
b) Develop a list of keyboards for which XKB keyboard layouts had previously been developed.
c) Develop a Maliit keyboard file that adds a layout needed to compelte thsoe previously developed as XKB files or that adds a keyboard needed to represent on of the languages for which we have an [translate.sugarlabs.org | active translation project].
This might be followed by tasks to develop Maliit keyboards for additional currently unsupported languages.
