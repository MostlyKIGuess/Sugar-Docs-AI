Introduction
Yet another user and volunteer intending to deploy Sugar on
Arch Linux
.
To-do
Prepare buildscripts for Arch (or at least start an effort so that others can do it)
Initiate official packaging for Arch (get a developer or Trusted User to adopt once buildscripts are ready)
Prepare third-party packages for Arch if official approach fails (possibly distributed via an unofficial project site/repository)
