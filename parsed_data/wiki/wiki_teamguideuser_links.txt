--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The
user links
at the top right side of every page give you control of your preferences, let you review your contributions, or see what pages you are watching.  There are also links to your own talk and user pages.
The
my contributions
link takes you to a list of all the pages
you
have edited or created.
The
my watchlist
link shows the status of all the pages you are watching.  Use the
watch
tab at the top of any page to add it to the watch list.  You will then receive an e-mail whenever that page changes.
The
my preferences
link lets you adjust your viewing and editing   preferences.
The
my talk
link takes you to your own "talk" page.   Think of it as the white board outside your office door where people can leave you messages, or you can leave a response.
The link with your name on it takes you to your "User" page, where you can put a little something about yourself for the benefit of the other users.  It will help them know more about who you are.
