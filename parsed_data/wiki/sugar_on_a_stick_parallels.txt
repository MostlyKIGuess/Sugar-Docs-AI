Sugar on a Stick
At the pilot school for SoaS in Boston all the teachers have Apple laptops. We expect the most convenient way for the teachers to run Sugar will be as an emulation of their existing laptop.
These are instructions for using a copy of Sugar on a Stick configured to run in Parallels. It is a Parallels disk image created from SoaS that allows saving changes and includes Parallels Tools which allows 1024x768 resolution.
First download the parallels disk image () then unzip this file and remember where you put it.  While you are waiting for SoaS to download you can set up Parallels.
Note:
Parallels is for Intel-based Macs.
Install Parallels
OS X
Download Parallels for OS X from here,

Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the download.
