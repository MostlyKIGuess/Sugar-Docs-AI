Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Sugar ARM status
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Sugar_ARM_status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Most Sugar activities are written in Python, but some have external dependencies on compiled code. Since Sugar now supports non-x86 architectures, e.g., ARM, we need to ensure that these dependences are available for ARM.
Task
Identify which Sugar Activities have external dependencies that need to be built for ARM.
