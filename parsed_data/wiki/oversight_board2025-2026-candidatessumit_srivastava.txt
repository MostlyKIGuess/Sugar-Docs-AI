Sumit Srivastava as #1 preference on Sugar Labs Oversight Board
Dear Sugar Labs community members,
I would like you to
choose me as your first preference in the upcoming elections
. Here's why:
About Me
I've dedicated the
past 7-8 years of my life to Sugar Labs
, working passionately on projects that I believe are transforming education globally. My most significant contribution has been with
MusicBlocks, where I've worked closely with Devin and Walter Bender
, investing countless hours to make music education accessible to all.
What sets me apart is my complete commitment to Sugar Labs' mission - I've consistently
donated 100% of my mentorship stipends back to the project
, demonstrating my belief that our work transcends personal gain.
Vision
Sugar Labs stands at a crucial juncture where traditional education meets artificial intelligence. Our sister project OLPC inspired Android (as noted by Sundar Pichai), and I believe we can achieve even greater impact.
My vision is to:
Transform Sugar Labs into the world's most influential educational project
Integrate AI capabilities thoughtfully into our educational tools
Expand our global reach through policy-level implementations
Establish Sugar Labs as a pioneer in AI-enhanced education
Concrete Commitments
If elected, I will:
- Personally secure computational resources for Sugar Labs' AI initiatives, leveraging my proven track record and connections in organizations I've worked with
- Lead the effort to build and maintain our AI infrastructure, ensuring Sugar Labs has the computing power needed for next-generation educational tools
- Work towards incorporating Sugar Labs' projects into national education policies across multiple countries
- Represent Sugar Labs at international conferences to build partnerships and increase our sphere of influence
- Actively promote our projects across various platforms - from academic conferences to schools to social media
Why I'm Different
While others talk about organizational structure, I focus on exponential impact. I have a proven record of securing computational resources and will personally
ensure Sugar Labs has the AI infrastructure it needs to innovate
. I've been
actively promoting Sugar Labs everywhere - from conferences to schools, from parent meetings to YouTube discussions
. My approach is hands-on and results-driven, proven by my years of tangible contributions to projects like MusicBlocks.
The learning mode of children is evolving rapidly, with AI at its forefront. We need leadership that understands both our rich history and the transformative potential of new technologies. With your support, I'll help Sugar Labs not just adapt to these changes but lead them, and
I will personally help with securing the computational resources necessary for our AI initiatives and try to get Sugar Labs projects in national curriculum of as many countries as possible
while trying to make it the most important education project in the world.
Please vote for me as your #1 preference.
Together, we can make Sugar Labs the defining force in teaching the next gen of our world.
Thank you for considering my candidacy.
