Current status
Targeted release: 0.115
Last updated: 2019-08-29
Percentage of completion: 10%
Detailed Description
Port to Python 3 via the Six environment.
Security updates and upstream support for Python 2 are due to be withdrawn, and this will prevent running Sugar on Linux.
Downstream distributions are removing Python 2 packages.
Benefit to Sugar
Benefit to the platform is continued availability.  Activities will have access to Python 3 language features.  Systems with Python 2 available will continue to run Python 2 activities.
Scope
Components to be changed include datastore (carquinyol), toolkit (sugar3), gwebsockets, artwork, shell (jarabe), and Sucrose activities.
Specific changes are tracked at
https://github.com/orgs/sugarlabs/projects/1
UI Design
No UI impact.
How To Test

User Experience
Systems without Python 2 available will have a severe reduction in available activities.
Dependencies
None.
Contingency Plan
None.  Sugar will be in jeopardy.
