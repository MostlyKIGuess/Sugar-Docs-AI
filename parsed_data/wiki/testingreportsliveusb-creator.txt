[SoaS] SoaS windows USB builder
01:14 PM 01/21/2011
Kevin Gordon
Folks:
It would appear that the fix which now allows the Fedora Windows USB builder
to now correctly create a bootable USB stick of the most recent F14 based
SoaS USB (with syslinux 4.03),  the app now no longer properlry creates the
previous SoaS versions (the berries) from the spin ISO's, that will boot.
Workaround appears to be to use the same methodology as before but in the
case where one wants to create older version bootable usb's,  one now
manually copies an  *older* 3xx syslinux into the windows working directory
before doing the build
Full instructions for this method are listed in this SoaS digest in previous
posts.  If one didn't keep their old syslinux, its available in the archives
at
