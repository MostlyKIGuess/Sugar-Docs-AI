Introduction
Sucrose 0.92 is the latest version of the
Sugar learning platform
: Sugar promotes collaborative learning through
Sugar Activities
that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality education. Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software. Furthermore it provides a flexible and powerful platform for activity developers.
Sugar is Free and Open Source Software and consists of
Glucose
, the base system environment; and
Fructose
, a set of demonstration activities. This new release contains many new features, performance and code improvements, bug fixes, and translations.
What is new for users
What is new for distributors and deployers
What's new for developers
The following changes are important for developers using the Sucrose 0.90 developer platform.
Widgets
API
Activity Authors guidelines
There are still many activities that do not use the new activity toolbars introduced in 0.86. We encourage activity authors to use the new toolbars as there have been huge improvements in usability (e.g., stopping an activity).
Jim Simmons has written a guide to writing Sugar Activities (Please see
Make your own Sugar Activities!
) which details how to convert your activity to the new toolbars while still keeping backward compatibility with older Sugar versions.
