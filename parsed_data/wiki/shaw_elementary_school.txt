Next Steps at Shaw
Shaw School is a K-5 school in Dorchester with one computer lab with 256MG RAM older computers.  Currently they Run Windows 2000.  The goal is to get
Sugar on a Stick
to run on the computer lab computers, then add some donated computers into the spaces used by afterschool programs to increase student access to computers.
Current Status at Shaw
SoaS1 from 3/18/08 boots until we are just about to see the name screen. Then the screen turns to static.  Our guess is we don't have the right driver for the video/graphics card.
We see two ways forward.
1 Fix the graphics driver issue
2. Create a virtual image that works on Window2000 and looks for student's files on the USB Stick.
