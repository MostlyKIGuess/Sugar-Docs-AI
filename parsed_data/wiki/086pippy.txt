Introduction
Pippy is a simple integrated development environment (IDE) for the Python programming language. It provides a menu of sample files, a text editing window, and simple controls for running and stopping the selected code.
More Info: See the
Activities/Pippy
page in the wiki.
There is a list of
Python resources
in the Activity Team pages.
