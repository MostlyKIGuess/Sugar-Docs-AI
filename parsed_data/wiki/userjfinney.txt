About Me
Hello, I am Jameson Finney, a 3rd year Information Security & Forensics, or ISF, major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I have an interest in emergency relief, especially communications and asset tracking. I am a licensed amateur radio operator with the call-sign KI4JOA. At RIT, I have taken classes in C++ and BASH. I also have taught myself a little bit of PHP and SQL on a summer side project.
