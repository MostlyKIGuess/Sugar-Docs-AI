Introduction
This is a series of tutorials on working your way down through the various parts of the XO development stack, top to bottom, following the things I'm doing (as a new developer-intern) to get started. Lessons will be posted here and announced on the devel mailing list; you're more than welcome to follow along if you like. I'm trying to write the tutorials so that they can be followed by a smart 13-year-old or someone without a development/engineering background. (It'll just take a while to get through the prerequisites in lesson 0.)
If you're having trouble working through one of these tutorials, it is a bug and I should fix it, so please test them out and leave feedback and comments on what you like, what you don't like, and how they can be improved.
