This manual tries to provide you with the answers you need to get started either by contributing to existing projects or starting your own development project.  Although this Developer's Manual focuses mostly on the software development side of the process, we are also very interested in encouraging the contributions of:
Designers
Educators
Testers
Documenters
Translators
Much of the material in the Developer's manual, particularly the Setup and Communications sections will be applicable to you as well.
Developers/Setup
Describes how to set up a
Sugar
development environment, with a discussion of which approach is likely to be the most appropriate for you
Developers/Stack
Describes the "operating stack" of the OLPC
Sugar
environment, the combination of hardware, operating system, services, libraries and activities that combine to form the environment in which you will be programming
Developers/Issues
Describes the special considerations required for working on the OLPC project, particularly those driven by our target hardware and deployment environments
Developers/Projects
Suggests ways to choose a particular project, whether one that already exists, or one of your own, and how to start working on the project once you have chosen it
Developers/Communication
Describes the various support and communications channels used by the project, including how to get help with problems, and how to set up your own per-project communications channels
Developers/Documentation
Collects pointers to the various sources of documentation available for the project.  Helping us better document our code is always a welcome contribution.
Development Team/FAQ
Collects and attempts to answer common questions that developers have when working on the Sugar platform
Release Schedule
We expect to be doing updates monthly through the first quarter of 2008. After that, we will likely adopt a three-month update cycle. Eventually we will adopt a six-month update cycle.  It should also be noted that we will be—when time permits—moving to a build environment that enables individual activity developers to maintain their own build cycles.
