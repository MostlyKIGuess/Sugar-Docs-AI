Help with Testing
With new builds coming in frequently, it is sometimes hard to keep track of known problems and temporary workarounds. Sometimes a build will not complete the boot process, or only start certain services. Testers can help other testers by organizing some of their findings here. Remember different hardware combinations may have different results.
Beta testing

Software Testing

.
Please keep notes on which version of Sugar on a Stick you have downloaded when reporting issues. You can refer to the name of the .iso file from the download source.
Fedora's boot menu
When booting SoaS, you'll see for a short time a Fedora screen showing a blue solar system.
By pressing the keyboard 'Escape' key here, you can get to Fedora's boot menu.
There, you should find the images name in the following structure:
Soas{version number}-{date of creation}
Pressing 'Tab' key from the boot menu will reveal the bootstrap command line. Removing the final command line parameter, 'rhgb' (RedHat graphical boot) using backspace and pressing the 'Enter' key will result in diagnostic messages being displayed on your console. Removing the 'quiet' parameter will print even more detailed messages.
Sugar version
To find out which version of the Sugar component you are using, you can look it up in the 'About my Computer' Section in 'My Settings'.
Bug reporting
Please file bug reports in
The Sugar on a Stick bug tracker
.
Here are
some instructions for using the bug tracker
.
See
Sugar on a Stick/Bugs
for all the tickets designated with the SoaS component/tag.
You must

This link will take you to a

(once you are logged in).
Archive note: (Beginning with SoaS v2 (but ending on 04 February 2010), bugs and new features were tracked at
http://launchpad.net/soas
.  See this
announcement
and this
announcement
.)
User test notes
Casual observations may be reported on this wiki (cross link bugs reports and test notes, as appropriate, to help document the problem).
Find your build version in the list of testing subpages below, or
create a new subpage for an unlisted version by going to a page for a previous version.
Then, in the address line of your browser, change the of the address string before the "&action=" segment to the version of the file (taken from the file date at the download page) and press <Enter>
(The full address line will be something like http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/index.php?title=Index.php&title=SoaS/Testing/Soas03&action=edit) For more help on this process, see this
help page section
.
Then enter a header line for your setup.
Finally, enter some observations.
You may also include video notes, such as in
Video Testing Sugar
.

Downloading alternative images
A variety of images for testing are available. Some of images might still be unstable; that means
they might not work yet.
Beta testing snapshots are at
Sugar on a Stick/Beta
.
A virtual appliance .vmdk file for use with VirtualBox or VMware is available at
Sugar Creation Kit/VirtualBox
.
The virtual appliances are
not ready
for general use, and are under heavy development. Any help with testing them is appreciated, though.
