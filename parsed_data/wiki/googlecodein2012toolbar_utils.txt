Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Toolbar utils
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Toolbar_utils
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
A set of toolbar utilities are used in about 10% of Sugar activities. It is proposed to
make these utilities part of the Sugar toolkit
. Since it is only in the utils that there is a direct reference the GTK classes, the conversion from GTK2 to GTK3 can be made essentially transparent to those activities that use them.
Task
Package up the utilities; write documentation; shepherd the package through the feature process.
