Mailing list discussion
We discussed the merits and pitfalls of limiting the SLOBs mailing list to SLOBs members, the ombudsman, and a representative of the SFC. CJB will present a summary of the discussion and make a motion to the board at the next meeting.
Appointed position protocol
We passed a resolution regarding appointed positions:
All appointed positions are to reviewed annually, within the first month following the oversight board elections. Appointed positions can be appointed/removed by an oversight board majority vote; an exception is regard to the removal of the ombusman, which requires a unanimous vote.
