Note that with larger images one may need to adjust the overlay or home folder size in order to fit the installation onto a 1-GB USB device (for example, with soas-x86_64-20101004.16.iso (503 MB),
--home-size-mb 190
was needed), otherwise, the filesystem will get corrupted during the creation of the home folder as the disc space is exhausted.
