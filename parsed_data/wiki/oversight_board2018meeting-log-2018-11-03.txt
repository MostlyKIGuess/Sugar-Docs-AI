<walterbender> any SLOB members here?
<walterbender> samsongoddy, ?
<walterbender> elverma, ?
<samsongoddy> Hello
<walterbender> hi
<walterbender> no quorum
<walterbender> and no one except you and I responded to the email motion.
<samsongoddy> Yeah
<walterbender> I think it is time to gear up for an election to vote in a new board that actually is interested in participating.
<samsongoddy> +1
<samsongoddy> I agree
<walterbender> I'll send an email reminding SLOB members to please vote.
<aaguirre_> hi
<walterbender> And another to the community looking for candidates
<samsongoddy> Agreed too
<walterbender> How was your US trip? Looked great in the photos
<walterbender> ^^ aaguirre_ 
<walterbender> samsongoddy, I think I will look up the stats on meeting attendance over the past few years by some of our long-time board members... it won't be pretty :P
<samsongoddy> There is alot the Board need to do
<walterbender> yes... but apparently 1 hour a month -- scheduled well in advance -- is too much of a commitment for our peers :(
<samsongoddy> Yeah
<samsongoddy> Maybe it is time we ask for commitment
<aaguirre_> it was great! :-)
<walterbender> I wouldn't care except the SFC won't let us do anything without the board vote.
<walterbender> samsongoddy, the commitment is implicit. everyone knows the rules
<samsongoddy> You are right
<walterbender> samsongoddy, anything else for today?
<walterbender> aaguirre_, check out the latest Music Blocks... lots-of-fun
<samsongoddy> Nothing really. I wanted to discuss about sugar labs vision
<samsongoddy> And goals
<samsongoddy> But i guess
<jaskirat> hi
<samsongoddy> We long propose goals
<samsongoddy> But currently we are working on just 30%
<samsongoddy> Of what was written down
<samsongoddy> I think those goals needs to be agreed on
<walterbender> samsongoddy, you and jaskirat should come up with a new marketing team agenda...
<samsongoddy> I am working on that
<samsongoddy> I am looking at Sean's previous plan
<samsongoddy> Soas
<jaskirat> <walterbender> thanks i am on it making some plans
* ibiam (~myirc@197.210.55.2) has joined
<walterbender> Let's cast a wide net first... and then narrow the scope.
<ibiam> Hi
<samsongoddy> Agreed
<samsongoddy> Ssoc
<samsongoddy> ?
<samsongoddy> Is that gonna be a thing as we discussed?
<walterbender> What is Ssoc?
<samsongoddy> Sugar Labs Summer of Code
<samsongoddy> The one you mentioned
<samsongoddy> Some meetings back
<walterbender> OK. I didn't recognize the acronym
<samsongoddy> I also plan to bring bac Sugar Labs ambassadors
<samsongoddy> *back
<samsongoddy> A group of advocates
<walterbender> Given that we have 12 interns from Google last year--about as many as we could find mentors for, adding another program is a bit sketchy
<walterbender> Ambassadors could be a good idea... but we need to spell out what it really means.
<ifeanyi_> Hi all, a bit late.
* sum2it has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
<walterbender> I'll post the log in the wiki.
<walterbender> Meanwhile, anyone with GCI ideas, please share them on Sugar Devel
<walterbender> or directly with Ibiam and me.
<samsongoddy> It has a document on the wiki
<jaskirat> okay sure
<samsongoddy> I will with you later
<ifeanyi_> Okay @walterbender
<walterbender> anything else for today?
* Ibiam_ (c5d236f6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.197.210.54.246) has joined
<jaskirat> <walterbender> is motion up ?
<jaskirat> i guess time is sensitive
<samsongoddy> Not from me
* ibiam has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
* ibiam (~myirc@197.210.54.97) has joined
<walterbender> jaskirat, no one showed to vote except the two of us who already voted.
<walterbender> I will send another email.
<ibiam> I'm a little lost
<ibiam> Network issues
<ibiam> What are we voting on
<jaskirat> okay thanks a lot , i guess if approved then sfc should not take another couple of days to make it move
<ifeanyi_> Are the emails tracked? Like number of opens, so we know the stats, if they are ignoring it or yet to access the mail
* Ibiam_ has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
* GrannieB_ (acfb389c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.172.251.56.156) has joined
<GrannieB_> Well... that is definitely a barrier to participation by people not familiar with irc. The most obtuse instructions I have ever seen
* jaskirat has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
<GrannieB_> OK so is this the meeting or not???
<ifeanyi_> Yes it is the meeting @GrannieB_
<ibiam> GrannieB_: it's to avoid the spam attacks
<ibiam> Only registered users can access the channel
<ifeanyi_> I started very early trying to bypass those barriers. It was quite difficult
<GrannieB_> Yes, but it is definitely a barrier. The instructions are scattered and not at all clear
<GrannieB_> I tried yesterday and then spent a lot of time today
<ifeanyi_> Maybe a documentation can help. Where and what to click to overcome the spam blocks
<ibiam> GrannieB_: the instructions are clear
<ibiam> It's just your chat client that requires you joining each time you want to use it
<ifeanyi_> You're very correct @ibiam . It's the chat client that is causing the glitches (at least from my end)
<walterbender> GrannieB_, maybe you can share your process -- obviously successful -- so others can learn from you?
<GrannieB_> I think I accidentally did it!
<GrannieB_> I actually registered twice... same name and pw, 2 confirmation emails
* sidhantb has quit (Quit: Page closed)
<walterbender> GrannieB_, let's be systematic about this. first the basics: what computer/OS are you using?
<walterbender> then, what tool did you use? browser? irc client?
<GrannieB_> Chrome freenode
<GrannieB_> but the order you do things in matters... a lot
* Mayank8055_ has quit (Quit: Page closed)
<GrannieB_> The first confirmation message I got would not work. It said the nick was already in use
<GrannieB_> The second one (same nick... different code from them) worked
<walterbender> GrannieB_, https://webchat.freenode.net/ ???
<GrannieB_> yes
<ibiam> GrannieB_: after you got the first message did you try to identify your nick
<walterbender> So it was just a matter of trying repeatedly?
* Hrishi_ has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
<GrannieB_> no. It was more than that. I could write some easier instructions if I can figure out how I did it. The main problem is where it tells you to "log in" and they aren't talking about a password or anything like that that I can see
<GrannieB_> When I was trying to log in with my nick it kept telling me that it was not available, that it was taken. After the second time registering it, things worked
<GrannieB_> The registration instructions are ok
<GrannieB_> it is what to do after that is messed up
<elverma> Hello
<elverma> Sorry, I got called awy
<elverma> I had a bunch of trouble logging in as well
<ibiam> GrannieB_: whatever you do after is because of your client
<walterbender> elverma, while we have your attention, please vote on the email motion re Jaskirat
<elverma> Will do
<ibiam> It always requires that you login each time you open it
* fnerk (497e4bb7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.73.126.75.183) has joined
<GrannieB_> OK what does it mean to "log in?"
<walterbender> I just followed the instructions at https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration and it worked first time...
<GrannieB_> Exactly how does one do that?
>NickServ< identify ****
-NickServ- You are already logged in as walterbender.
<walterbender> type /msg NickServ identify YOURPASSWORD
* fnerk has quit (Quit: Page closed)
<GrannieB_> When I finally got in, I went through the "not a robot" drill... I had put in my user name and that was all. Then when I got an irc screen, I pasted the message verifying my registration into the bar at the bottom, That got me in. then I changed channels to #sugar - meeting
<elverma> walterbender, I don't see the motion. Is it on SLOB?
<GrannieB_> Oh, and it told me my registration was complete after I pasted in the verification
<walterbender> elverma, I emailed it Wednesday and again about 10 minutes ago.
<walterbender> GrannieB_, Please see if https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Google_Code_In_2018/background#Getting_set_up_on_IRC matches your experience.
* walterbender needs to disappear in a few minutes.
* ibiam has to go
<elverma> walterbender Interesting. I see it on lists.sl.o but not in my email...something is broken.
<elverma> Can you record +1 from me for the motion?
<walterbender> will do...
<walterbender> maybe check your entry on the listserv
<elverma> walterbender: will do. Entire threads for Oct are missing in my email. Not in spam either.

<walterbender> hi everyone
<perrie> hello
<walterbender> Claudia will be joining in a minute
<walterbender> I see llaske and samsongoddy 
<llaske> Yes. Hi all
<walterbender> any other SLOB members here?
<samsongoddy> Yes
<samsongoddy> Claudia is having issues
<samsongoddy> With password
<samsongoddy> I am trying to help her out
<ibiam> Hi everyone
<walterbender> Let's wait another few minutes for Adam, Sameer, and Ignacio too
<samsongoddy> Okay sure
* iqra_ (~iqra@39.40.184.72) has joined
<walterbender> We can get started while we wait for Claudia.
<walterbender> #topic GCI
<walterbender>  a few stats: 371 students are participating so far
<walterbender> 258 tasks completed
<walterbender> Claudia is here via screen share
<walterbender> a lot of the tasks are beginner tasks -- make a pull request
<samsongoddy> Oh nice
<walterbender> or write a music blocks project
<walterbender> or design a promotional flyer
<walterbender> but some serious programming
<walterbender> a good start
<walterbender> and for the most part the mentors have been great
<walterbender> very responsive 
<walterbender> and constructive feedback
<samsongoddy> Yes, very helpful
<walterbender> any comments from the mentors ?
<samsongoddy> None from me
<llaske> I think it's a good start too
<walterbender> perrie, ?
<perrie> yeah
<perrie> the mentors have been doing well too
<walterbender> Anything else re GCI?
<walterbender> We should talk about the election
<walterbender> #topic SLOB election 2018
<walterbender> samsongoddy, can you lead us through this discussion?
<samsongoddy> Yeah
<samsongoddy> So i have set up a calendar
<samsongoddy> For the election
<samsongoddy> https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2018-2020-candidates
<samsongoddy> Announcement of election date and first call for candidates.
<samsongoddy> Start from 7th of August
<walterbender> August?
<samsongoddy> November
<samsongoddy> Sorry
<samsongoddy> 5 days from today
<walterbender> +1
<samsongoddy> Seat up for election are
<samsongoddy> Walter
<walterbender> who else is on the committee?
<samsongoddy> Sameer
<samsongoddy> Lionel
<samsongoddy> And Adam
<samsongoddy> By November 19th
<samsongoddy> We will make another call for candidate
<samsongoddy> *candidates
<samsongoddy> So wiki entry start from 7th of November
<walterbender> Can I make one request: that we implore people to run if and only if they are going to participate.
<samsongoddy> Yes
<samsongoddy> I agree
<samsongoddy> Too
<samsongoddy> Candidates must ensure commitments
<walterbender> We have a few SLOB members who never come to meetings and never respond to emails which makes it very difficult to get a quorum or vote on any motions
<samsongoddy> +1
<walterbender> and since the SFC won't let us do anything with out SLOB approval, we are often paralyzed
<samsongoddy> Agreed
<samsongoddy> So that is why from 1st to 15th of December
<walterbender> One hour meeting per month is not such a heavy burden
<samsongoddy> That will be the period for the election
<llaske> How many people vote ?
<walterbender> ANyway, thanks for doing this.
<samsongoddy> Well for now
<samsongoddy> I don't know the numbers
<walterbender> Usually we get about 100 votes
<walterbender> to the best of my recollection
<samsongoddy> But i will send a mail reminding members
<llaske> My question was: how to determine who is a member ?
<walterbender> We have guidelines in the Wiki
* satellit who can vote?
<ibiam> llaske, we have a members list
<samsongoddy> Member can vote only
<walterbender> a track-record of partiicipation
<walterbender> and they must opt in to membership
<samsongoddy> There is a wiki explaining guidelines to become member
<walterbender> but participation can be in many forms
<samsongoddy> ibiam correct me if i am wrong, we have more than 100 members on the our records, right?
* callaurrea (4904ef7a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.73.4.239.122) has joined
<callaurrea> yay
<samsongoddy> Welcome
* Pro-Panda has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
<walterbender> a few years back we had a membership committee more interested in removing members than adding them
<walterbender> but IMHO we should be as welcome as we can
<samsongoddy> So the membership committee will keep the community updated
<walterbender> we need the community to participate
<samsongoddy> As usual
<callaurrea> yes, we do
<walterbender> reminds me of the governor's race in the state of Georgia in the US
<llaske> Yes but as we've seen with GCI mentors, we should ensure real participation of people
<callaurrea> and I apologize for not being as present as I should have been in the last few months
<ibiam> Yes, we have over 150
<walterbender> one of the candidates is trying to win by preventing as many people as possible from voting.
<samsongoddy> I am also accepting any member interested in helping out on the election
<samsongoddy> Thanks, ibiam
<samsongoddy> So we have some numbers
<samsongoddy> I will make a public call
<samsongoddy> So I advice pontential candidates to start creating a wiki entry
<walterbender> llaske, I don't think we have any members who have not contributed. But we have many contributors who are not members.
<samsongoddy> Very important
<callaurrea> ok
<samsongoddy> +1 walterbender
<perrie> I'd love to help out
<walterbender> +1
<samsongoddy> Great
<callaurrea> walterbender: if we have you present at one of the lunches, we can recruit some people
<walterbender> perrie, maybe a promotional flyer to recruit membership :)
<walterbender> callaurrea, ok
<perrie> sure I can do that
<samsongoddy> +1 perrie
<samsongoddy> We can do some SM work
<samsongoddy> Too
<walterbender> get the word out on Social Media
<perrie> +1
<walterbender> which brings me to my last topic: Marketing
<samsongoddy> Starting from tomorrow, i will be having meeting with Perrie
<walterbender> any other issues about the election topic?
<samsongoddy> None from me
<callaurrea> What does it take to be a member?
* walterbender looks for the wiki page
<walterbender> one sec
<walterbender> https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members
<samsongoddy> It is pretty straight forward
<Quozl_> hi ho.
<walterbender> hi Quozl_ 
<samsongoddy> hi Quozl_
<perrie> hello Quozl_
<walterbender> so... 
<walterbender> #topic marketing
<callaurrea> Thanks, walterbender
<walterbender> There was a marketing meeting recently
<walterbender> I was unable to attend, but the log was posted to the lists.
<walterbender> Thanks to Samson et al for trying to breath some life into marketing
<walterbender> However...
<walterbender> It seems to me that we have 3 major initiatives underway, each of which is pretty cool and could be the subject of a systemic marketing plan
<walterbender> and I saw no plan emerge from the meeting.
<walterbender> (1) We have been supporting OLPC's efforts for 10+ years.
<walterbender> It would be great to do something joint with OLPC to sing the praises of that mutual effort
<ibiam> +1
<perrie> +1
<samsongoddy> Agreed
<walterbender> (2) Sugarizer is quite mature and we should be supporting Lionel in marketing it
<Quozl_> I'll talk to the CTO.  Oh, wait.  That's me.  Noted.
<callaurrea> +1 but, who is in touch with them?
<llaske> (1) is funny, we're are celebrating 10 years in OLPC France too :-)
<walterbender> (3) We have great traction in Japan with Music Blocks -- they plan to put it in all the elementary schools
<callaurrea> omg... that is great, walterbender
<ibiam> Awesome
<callaurrea> data collection???
<samsongoddy> Great news
<walterbender> We could make a big splash there
<perrie> awesome!
<llaske> Nice
<callaurrea> on point 1) are you in touch with OLPC?
<walterbender> so in addition to discussing swag, we should make a real plan in each of these three areas.
<walterbender> I am in touch with their CTO :)
<samsongoddy> I will work on it
<walterbender> But I can try to reach out to the Zamoras.
<walterbender> I also know Lionel :)
<walterbender> We can reach out to him.
<llaske> :-D
<walterbender> and I know Walter, so we can talk to him
<samsongoddy> What about trying to look into Rwanda?
<callaurrea> I meant the Zamoras
<llaske> In France we're planning to deploy Sugarizer in 3 schools at the begining of the year
<walterbender> +1
<callaurrea> Costa Rica?
<ibiam> Great!
<callaurrea> Paraguay?
<walterbender> Let's make a plan to make noise about that
<Quozl_> I know Jimmy in Rwanda.
<walterbender> Paraguay keeps doing interesting things
<samsongoddy> llaske, i am your guy on noise making
<samsongoddy> So I will help too
<walterbender> The Rwanda deployment must be 10 years old by now
<llaske> We've got now a Sugarizer Twitter and Facebook account
<samsongoddy> Great, saw them
<perrie>    would love to help out too
<walterbender> I don't want to make the plan now... just it seems we have great stuff to talk about and we should make a plan that is about that stuff
<walterbender> hint hint Marketing team
<samsongoddy> So I am going to pick out all points listed here and work on something
<samsongoddy> With the team
<llaske> Great
<ibiam> Re social media, our two
<walterbender> Let's plan to have a real plan to present at the next meeting.
<samsongoddy> +1 on that
<perrie> +1
<walterbender> and hopefully I will get email again from the lists... so I will know to attend.
<ibiam> Twitter page hasn't been posting things re gci, like weekly stats
<callaurrea> +1
<walterbender> that is my list
<walterbender> other topics?
<callaurrea> I am around.. and hopefully we can meet next week, walterbender
<walterbender> would be very nice
<samsongoddy> ibiam, I will address that issue
<ibiam> Great
<walterbender> perrie, we should start posting the flyers form GCI
<walterbender> some of them are really great
<llaske> could you share link on it?
<walterbender> perrie, are they in the wiki?
<perrie> yeah sure, we have some ready.. we have style guidelines too for posting on our social media
* satellit remeber this also http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XS_Community_Edition
<satellit> #schoolserver
<samsongoddy> Yes, I am looking on those guide also
<perrie> I will upload all tonight and share the link
<walterbender> thx
<walterbender> satellit, please proceed
<satellit> this is a nice project to mention also
<llaske> +1 and it miss a landing page to explain the project
<walterbender> Would be great to learn more about it... we never hear anything
<satellit> look at thw olpc link
<satellit> the*
<llaske> Yes but most communication on the project is on Git or on the mailing list
<llaske> It deserve more marketing
<walterbender> (4) school server
<Quozl_> Don't think XSCE or IIAB as it has become is interested in Sugar compatibility; from what I last heard, they had pulled those components.
<satellit> I agree but I only test here  contact adam for more inf
<walterbender> who is adam :P
<llaske> BTW Sugarizer is include in IIAB :-)
<Quozl_> Adam Holt is the public relations contact for the project.
<walterbender> I guess someone should tell him about Sugar :P
<Quozl_> If they have Sugarizer, that's enough to get Sugar Labs engaged.
* satellit http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XS_Community_Edition#Our_Community
<walterbender> teasing aside, it would be nice if we were engaged more regularly
<llaske> MusicBlock is not directly related to Sugar but it could be supported by SugarLabs
<callaurrea> could we do a info session about all of these wonderful things... it would be a great way to get people exited and recruit new members
<satellit> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nf_6raUpsrTV-peSbV_FeM_zIOMqLZzUrvvEMrp3c2g/edit
<walterbender> Music Blocks runs in Sugar but not on the F18 version
<walterbender> Not sure I can fix that
* walterbender should update the bundle with the latest bits
<llaske> walterbender do you have a look on Electron technology ?
<Quozl_> You're each responsible for staying informed.
<walterbender> yes... someone on the Japan team is working on that
<llaske> It's a good way to distribute apps in multiple environment with an embedded Chromium browser
<llaske> so it's easier to maintain. Next version of Sugarizer will rely on it for Linux/Windows/MacOS
<walterbender> https://github.com/ukkari/musicblocks-electron
<Quozl_> Good.  Endless OS has been very happy with Electron.
<llaske> Great
<llaske> Lot of tools (Slack, Discord, Atom, ...) use it
<walterbender> Where I am still struggling is with Edge :P
<llaske> :-D
<samsongoddy> Edge😂😂
<walterbender> anything else for today?
<samsongoddy> Isn't edge responsible for downloading chrome
<perrie> lol
<callaurrea> happy to have been here
<samsongoddy> Yeah, you made it
<samsongoddy> Did you fix the password ?
<walterbender> https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/10/27/stop-using-microsoft-edge-to-download-chrome-unless-you-want-malware/#3d8910f613ea
<callaurrea> definitely lots to share with the world... happy to think about sharing
<callaurrea> yes, Samson
<callaurrea> thanks for the help... I think I am all set for the next one
<samsongoddy> Awesome
<walterbender> I need to attend to my grandkids. 
<walterbender> Thanks everyone
<callaurrea> have a good weekend
<samsongoddy> Great meeting
<llaske> Thanks. Bye.
<callaurrea> call you monday
<callaurrea> bye
<walterbender> I'll post the log to the wiki
<walterbender> bye
<perrie> bye everyone
<samsongoddy> Bye
