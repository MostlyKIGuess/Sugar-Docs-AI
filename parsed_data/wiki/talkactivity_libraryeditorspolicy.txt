FOSS
I support the inclusion of non open source software in ASLO. If it is Sugar compatible and has educational value, why restrict kids access to it. It is an education project first and foremost (though there are other considerations).
I do think the software should be free (zero cost) because the inclusion of commercial software may lead to a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interrest. Tony
Respect acitvity developers
Editlors should respect the priority of developers and take a look only on following ASLO policy for particular activity. There are several way how editors can make their statement exposed without changing uploaded activities itself or restricting access (being logged in), e.g., something like making a stamp that this particular version was tested, make this activity recommended.
