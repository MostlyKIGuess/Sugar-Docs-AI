Sucrose 0.82.1 Release Notes
Announcement
This release was about stabilizing and many bugs were fixed. Thanks to all the translators we were able to get many new translations in. We want to devote this release to
FUDCon
since as one of many fixes it provides a more 'standard' system installation for bundles which helps when packaging activities for Fedora.
Thanks
