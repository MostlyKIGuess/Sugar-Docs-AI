Agenda
GSoC and DMP report (Walter, Lionel, and Ibiam)
Discussion on Ibiam's proposal to update Sugar packages for Fedora
GSoC students require resources to deploy their AI projects.
GSoC and DMP report
The MIDI and ABC import code has landed.
The Gen-AI Lesson Plan project is wrapping up and is awesome.
Sugar on RPi is a much better experience now. We need to promote it.
(The students who worked on RPi had come up with some promotional materials, so we can use those.)
Both GSoC and DMP projects are going good so far, tested some changes they made earlier today, the RPi students are trying to build an image, Ibiam made some changes after the errors Aayush noticed during his last test.
The AI projects are a bit on hold until we figure out the resources issue. (Devin has been recommending
https://console.groq.com/playground
to students for now, as it runs LLAMA etc and is gratis.)
Sugar packages for Fedora
In an email dated 8/19, Ibiam said: "Quite a number of sugar packages - about 30 - have failed to build in F41, I looked at some of them but not in depth, I fixed some but that's a lot of packages and some are probably not issues with Sugar, I can draft up a contract to fix most if not all the packages if the board agrees."
+1 from Devin, Claudia, and Walter; Samson +1'd by email
GSoC resources
There a plan to host something on our servers for dev purposes. (We need a different solution for deployment.)
The plan is in regard to the collab server for MB, but it could just as well work for the AI projects. And then we move to AWS if that grant comes through (we should hear within a couple of weeks).
Follow the fun here:

Ibiam will follow up with hosting options.
