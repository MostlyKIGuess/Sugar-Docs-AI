Fonts
: By default, only a few writing systems are
covered
. You need to use
yum search -- -fonts
in Terminal to find
available font packages
, and
yum install
name
-font
to install a font package.
You can try to install the fonts from other sources in your system during activity startup. The font files should be copied to $HOME/.fonts. To be sure that the fonts get "registered", run the command fc-cache, and then you can start up your activity.
