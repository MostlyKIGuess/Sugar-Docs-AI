Detailed Description
In Uruguay, we developed activity EscribirEspecial for handicapped children (
http://activities.sugarlabs.org/es-ES/sugar/addon/4265
).
EscribirEspecial has a system scanning buttons to write and the activity writes on abiword.
When active the scanning, start scanning in a linear, if the user click on box of virtual keyboard, start scanning the buttons (letters) of this line, and again the user click on virtual keyboard and write this letter. This allows for example if the user can press click but can not move mouse or use the default keyboard.
Now, the idea is to develop a virtual keyboard for Sugar repositories to write on different activities or different text entries of Sugar.
Benefit to Sugar
Handicapped users will be able to write on different activities or different text entries in Sugar.
Scope
We started development of the virtual keyboard in Spanish as a global key extension, with keyboard layout and keyboard type laptop xo.
