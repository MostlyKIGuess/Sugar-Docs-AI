Please see the Contest Rules for Eligibility and Registration process.
http://www.google-melange.com/gci/document/show/gci_program/google/gci2013/terms_and_conditions
Details regarding the required forms and paperwork are here:
Google Code In 2013/Participate#Students
.
Also, you will likely need to set up the Sugar development environment. See
http://developer.sugarlabs.org/dev-environment.md.html
for details. Further information about contributing to the project can be found here:
http://developer.sugarlabs.org/
Please don't hesitate to ask questions on our irc channel (#sugar on irc.freenode.net) or on the sugar-devel list: sugar-devel AT lists.sugarlabs DOT org
Why we are participating
Sugar is written and maintained by volunteers, who range from seasoned professionals to children as young as 12-years of age. Children who have grown up with Sugar have transitioned from Sugar users to Sugar App developers to Sugar maintainers. They hang out on IRC with the global Sugar developer community and are full-fledged members of the Sugar development team. It is this latter group of children we hope will participate in and benefit from Google Code-in. Specifically we want to re-enforce the message that Sugar belongs to its users and that they have both ownership and the responsibility that ownership implies. Just as learning is not something done to you, but something you do, learning with Sugar ultimately means participating in the Sugar development process. At Sugar Labs, we are trying to bring the culture of Free Software into the culture of school. So the Code-in is not just an opportunity for us to get some tasks accomplished, it is quintessential to our overall mission.
Tasks
Note:
This is our preliminary list of tasks. We can add more as the contest progresses.
Mentors: please feel free to add more tasks and/or add yourself as a potential mentor to an existing task.
Tasks must fall within one of these five categories:
#Documentation/Training
;

; and
#Code
.
