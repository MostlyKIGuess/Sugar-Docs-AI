What is
Lanzar
?
Lanzar
is a very simple darts game targeted for children with motor difficulties. The basic goal of this game is to help them improve their precision in using the button.
The gameplay is as follows:
At first a vertical line moves horizontally until any key is pressed.
Once a key was pressed the vertical line will remain fixed and a horizontal line will appear and it will be moving vertically, until any key is pressed.
After this key press, a dart will be shown at the intersection of the lines and a corresponding score will be shown.
Pressing any key again will restart the game.
