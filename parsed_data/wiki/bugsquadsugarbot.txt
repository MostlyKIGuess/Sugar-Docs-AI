Google Summer of Code 2008
sugarbot's aim is to provide testing and automation facilities for the OLPC Project's Sugar GUI.  The project must first identify and evaluate possible implementation options, and then implement the best choice.  Although it has a Sugar focus, sugarbot should be easily extensible to other Python-based GUI's.
