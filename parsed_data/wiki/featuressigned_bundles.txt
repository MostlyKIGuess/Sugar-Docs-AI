Summary
Signed bundles are bundles which have been cryptographically signed to verify the identity of their creator, or for other purposes.  The specification was written by OLPC but never fully implemented.
Owner
This feature is looking for someone to adopt it.
Current status
Targeted release:
Last updated:
Percentage of completion: 10%
Detailed Description
See
olpc:Contents_manifest_specification
Benefit to Sugar
Signed bundles would allow deployments to guarantee that bundles were created by the holder of specific key.
Scope
The signing tools are available at
http://dev.laptop.org/git/projects/olpc-contents/
Support for parsing the format, maintaining "root keys", and displaying the keys via some user interface would need to be implemented in Sugar.
How To Test
Features/Signed Bundles/Testing
User Experience
This needs to be fleshed out.  But, when a bundle is signed, the user would likely see some information in the Journal indicating who signed it.
Dependencies
Contingency Plan
We could switch from .xo to .rpm or another format with built-in support for signing.
