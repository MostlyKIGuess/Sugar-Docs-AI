Sugar API Changes
Deprecations
sugar.activity.activity
self._shared_activity is deprecated in 8.2.0 and will be removed in 9.1.0. Use self.shared_activity instead.
Additions
sugar.presence.sugartubeconn
Use SugarTubeConnection instead of TubeConnection to get resolution of Telepathy handles to Buddies without needing the get_buddy boilerplate function. See this
commit to Connect
to see how to use it.
System API Changes
8.2.0 was based on Fedora 9, whereas 8.1.x was based on Fedora 7.
The package changes between 8.1.x and 8.2.0 are listed on

. It includes several cases where two packages were folded into one or a package was renamed.
Removed
python-numeric
This package is not present in 8.2, use numpy instead.
