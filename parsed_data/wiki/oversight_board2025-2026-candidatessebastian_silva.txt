About Me
Hi, I’m Sebastián Silva, also known as Icarito. I’ve been part of Sugar Labs since 2008, contributing in various ways, including mentoring in Google Summer of Code and developing educational tools. I’m also the creator of one of the most popular Sugar Activities, HablarConSara -

, an old chatbot integrated with Speak.
I’ve always believed in the power of free software to transform education, and I’d love to continue supporting Sugar Labs as part of the oversight board.
Vision
I've since worked on facilitating learning of novice programmers, I'd love revisit our learning routes. Also I'm involved in a Laptop project that doesn't use Sugar. Would love to reduce the distance to making it useful for us.
Goals
If elected to the oversight board, I commit to:
Attending meetings regularly to stay actively involved in decision-making.
Supporting community projects and helping contributors bring their ideas to life.
Working to expand Sugar Labs’ reach and make it accessible to more educators, students, and developers.
I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute further and support the amazing work of this community.
