Summary of changes
Sugar
Add age and gender to intro pages and About Me settings; configurable limits imposed on the number of open activities; activities can be limited to opening a single instance at a time; improvements to the updater; reworking of wireless control panel; improvements to batch processing; improvements to View Source; removal of OLPC-specific code from Control Panel; improvements to the layout of the Web Accounts Control Panel; improvements to the layout of the Languages Control Panel; improvements to the Journal toolbar filters; improvements to the Sugar notification system; new mechanism for adjusting microphone input level; and an improved backup mechanism in the Control Panel.
Sugar Toolkit
Conversion to gsettings; improvements to mimetype handling; Journal searching; inhibit suspend while activity is sharing
Sugar Artwork
New icons for backup and restore; age and gender; document-open. Improvements to the battery-charging icons. Some style improvements.
Sugar Activities (Fructose)
Pippy, the Sugar Python editor got a major overhaul. It supports multiple tabs and numerous new export mechanisms. In combination with Turtle Blocks, it is now possible to create new Sugar Activities entirely within Sugar itself: (1) Create a Turtle Blocks project; (2) Export the project as Python; (3) Import the Python code into Pippy; and (4) Export the Python code as a Sugar Activity. You can even create a Sugar icon for your project using Turtle Blocks, which can export projects to Python. The Chat activity had a major stylistic overhaul.
Other Sugar Activities (Honey)
Major updates to Maze, Spirolaterals, Fraction Bounce, Words, Music Painter, et al.
What is new for users
optionally capture age and gender for each user
refactored the notification system
added labels to the icons on the webservices control panel
refactored the journal toolbar filters
refactored the language control panel (separating language selection from region selection)
added an adjustment for the microphone level
Built-in backup and restore tool
The new chat look and feel
Winning Turtle Art project from Turtle Art Day Kathmandu
The same project as Python code.
limit the number of open activities
limit certain activities to one open instance at a time
the proper icon appears on the Frame when running non-Sugar activities
videos
Gonzalo Odiard has prepared videos of some of the new Sugar features (Sugar 100 and 102):

What's new for developers
See
[1]
icon_size is deprecated (use pixel_size)
Conversion to gsettings (gconf is deprecated)
max_participants is moved to activity.info and is "honored", i.e., users will not be able to join an activity where max_participants has been reached until someone drops out. (max_participants as specified in activity.py is deprecated.)
How to contribute with testing
Testing and reporting issues is a big help for the developing team.
You can set up the Sugar developer environment by following the instructions found at
http://developer.sugarlabs.org
