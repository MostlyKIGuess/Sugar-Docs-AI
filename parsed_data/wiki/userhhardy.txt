My chief priorities for SugarLabs
1. Improve sugar as a tool for learning and communicating; creating ideas, love and joy.
2. Remain independent of undue corporate or government control or influence.
3. Foster a community with substantive and constructive discussion.
4. Not let egotism and pride get in the way of humbleness and consideration for others.
5. Improve the build and release process.
6. Put a computer in the hands of everyone.
7. Use education to create a community to foster peace, tolerance, creativity and love.
General Principles
We reject: kings, presidents and voting.
We believe in: rough consensus and running code.
--Dave Clark, former IAB (Internet Activities Board) chief
TCP implementations will follow a general principle of robustness:  be 
conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.
--Jon Postel,
RFC 793
Information wants to be free
--Stewart Brand
Free your mind and your ass will follow

All power to the imagination
