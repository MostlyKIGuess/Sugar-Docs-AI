Current status
Targeted release: 1.0
Last updated: 29 July 2013
Percentage of completion: 90% (sugar3/presence/buddy.py, jarabe/model/buddy.py, and jarabe/view/buddyicon.py are finished. Need to finalize the teacher icon design and test.)
Detailed Description
For several different applications in the
Features/Classroom management
feature, we need to be able to identify the classroom teacher. We are proposing adding a new field to the buddy presence system to mark a buddy as a teacher. This will be used in the GUI to make it easier to find the teacher in the neighborhood view and also in some of the automated classroom management processes where activities share information with the teacher.
Benefit to Sugar
By adding a mechanism for identifying a teacher, we can automate many of the
Features/Classroom management
features, such as handing in assignments, sharing stats, etc.
Scope
The feature requires:
adding a new field to sugar3/presence/buddy.py
adding a new field to jarabe/model/buddy.py
a new icon for a teacher XO
a test in jarabe/view/buddyicon.py for the teacher buddy
UI Design
As a placeholder, we are using an upside-down XO icon for teacher-xo.svg
How To Test
Features/Teacher Buddy/Testing
User Experience
If the feature is not exploited, there is no change to the user experience.
The basic change to the user experience is simply a different icon to represent a teacher in the UI. The auto-detection of teachers will be exploited in the
Features/Classroom management
systems.
The exact mechanism for setting the teacher boolean (in gconf) is to be determined.
Dependencies
No new dependencies
Contingency Plan
No impact as this is a new feature.
