1. Congratulations to Ignacio Rodr√≠guez and Sam Parkinson, the grand-prize winners from Sugar Labs in

All five did great work, fixing bugs, writing documentation, and taking us to new places.
2. Since the contest finished, Ignacio and Sam have continued to contribute patches almost daily to
Turtle Blocks JS
