Why
The Conozco Uruguay (C U!) community exploration tour will bring South American (and the world's) most passionate edutechnologists and committed teachers/mentors together, to witness Uruguay's and Plan Ceibal's profound journey.  In conjunction with Uruguay's stongest volunteers, from CeibalJAM! to RAP Ceibal to Flor de Ceibo and beyond.  As the single country which has done the most with
One Laptop per Child
's XO Laptop and
Sugar Labs'
software (the Sugar Learning Platform) there are few places on earth where humankind's increasing marriage to educational technology is on more vivid display.
Similar to the famous Sugar Activity
Conozco
Uruguay
itself!
Who is Welcome
Tech-savvy education people from around South America.  Education-savvy hackers from around the world.  While
OLPC and Sugar Labs experience
is not required -- nor is Spanish fluency -- enthusiasms around bringing exploratory learning into the 21st century are!
We assume participants will also participate in Montevideo's
Uruguay Summit 2011
May 5-7, focusing on practical futures for free educational software.
Finally, attendance will in fact be limited to a maximum number of (approximately) 15 independent travelers.
Itinerary
Participants must be independent, able to travel lightly and completely self-sufficiently.  Day trips in and around Montevideo, from Saturday April 30 until Wednesday/Thursday May 4/5.

How on Earth is this Possible?
Volunteers from RAP Ceibal, CeibalJAM! and Flor de Ceibo have spent over 3 years building real-world community networks to bring Uruguay's youth and families more meaningfully into the 21st century.  If globalism means anything at all, it means paying full and proper respect to people like these who organize to make a difference!
Housing
Hostel-style options to be determined. Uruguayans eat well!!
Uruguay (generally) uses
220V European
electrical outlets
so please consider bringing a small converter.
Wifi access will be sought where possible, but not guaranteed.
Please see
Discussion
page for questions and discussion related to Housing.
Cost
Expect to pay $300-500 or higher for housing/food/bus etc to cover your 6 days, from Saturday April 30 to Thursday May 5 inclusive.  Homestays may reduce this cost if we are so lucky to build strong local relationships.
Pre-Registration
Please write to
holt@laptop.org
explaining what you hope to bring to the group!  Thanks for including the reasons you're interested -- and what you want to get out of this lifetime opportunity.  Remember to list ALL allergies and medical conditions, roommate preferences, as well as your phone number(s).
Reality Check: If you are looking for packaged voluntourism and flush toilets at every turn, you've come to the wrong place.  Have you traveled in developing countries before?  You must be an independent traveler, open-hearted with all comers, understanding Uruguay is a safe country but not without its risks.
And Take Complete
Medical
/Insurance/Safety/Financial Precautions Now!
THANKS everyone for
mindfully preparing
together today, for a trip more rewarding than money can buy.
