Note that to be included on ASLO, an activity must have a license as described
here
.
To whomever added the "Meets Soas Criteria" column, it was my understanding that these were criteria by which to weigh the decision as to whether or not to include an activity, not a pass/fail test. --

Ideas for revision
Have a criteria, or want to revise one? This is the section to do it in.
Add your own idea here
Be sure to describe:
Rationale:
Where does this requirement come from and why is it important?
Test:
how we can make sure that the requirement is met - what sort of testing needs to be done to verify this?
Instructions:
links to instructions on how Activity authors and maintainers can fulfill the requirement, if possible.
IDEA
: Color code activities listed based on criteria fulfilled
Rationale
: Gives a visual cue for developers that one or more criteria are not complete or accurate.
Test
: Activities are listed in RED until each criteria has been addressed and filled in with an active link.
Instructions
: Add activity to list. Test each criteria and set status appropriately. When all criteria are fulfilled, color of activity changes to BLACK.
IDEA
: Add +/- ranking to criteria in table
Rationale
: Add ranking to criteria to encourage better documentation.
Test
: Validate if minimum criteria has been met. Subjective assessment follows to determine + or - ranking.
Instructions
: By default, a checkmark (and hyperlink) is placed in the table for each criteria met. If the documentation at the link destination is an excellent example, add a + to the checkmark in table. If it's poor or incomplete documentation, add a - to the checkmark.
IDEA
: Add a legend for the criteria table
Rationale
: Gives clear indication of criteria status
Test
: n/a (as above, this is more about the table's functionality and accuracy)
Instructions
: Make sure that all icons in the table are represented in the legend
