There is a native linux version of liveusb-creator and also a script which should work on any distribution (see the Linux section). -- Marcopg
Ubuntu
I think the comments about Ubuntu on this page are confusing. I'm not sure if Caroline settled on using Fedora, but in any case I think we should limit ourself to one distribution for soas or make it very clear which distribution we are talking about. For one, if people flash different distributions and report bugs to the soas component, we will have an hard time to figure out what they are talking about. --marcopg

Tried soas-7 and 8 and it hands right after starting CUPS - it seems there is a display problem (Geode driver missing?), because the screen flashes every few seconds as the gui is trying to be started probably...

Snappier Name Suggestion
SoaS is kinda pedestrian as a name.  How about "Lollipop"?  After all a lollipop is sugar on a stick.

SoaS on Parallels
While I haven't test thoroughly, I'm pleased to note that setting up Sugar On A Stick on Parallels Desktop on an Intel-based Mac Mini works very well. Creating a new virtual machine matches the Virtual Box notes.
When you are satisfied with your testing, please report this on the 'parent' page, perhaps modifying the
VirtualBox and Sugar on a Stick
section.  That way others are more likely to see and follow your efforts.  Thanks!  --

Problems
1
I tried to do this and was able to create the files on the stick, but when I try to book on a Toshiba Tecra M4
(which can boot from USB sticks) I get
SYSLINUX 3.72 2008-0925-25 EBIOS Copyright (C) 1994-2008 H. Peter Unvin
Could not find kernel image: linux

when running  the script as intended under ubuntu, this is the result:

Partition isn't marked bootable!
You can mark the partition as bootable with
# /sbin/parted /dev//
   (parted) toggle N boot
   (parted) quit
Cleaning up to exit...
When booting from the usb key, I get the same problem as in problem 1 above.

Try this (at least in Ubuntu 8.10) menu: System -> Administration -> Partition Editor (GParted).
Select your USB device (/dev/sdb in your case),
then your partition (/dev/sdb1),
then menu: Partition -> Manage Flags,
check the boot box,
and Close to mark the partition as bootable.

The usb key is marked as bootable, the main problem now is the "340: udevinfo: not found" error.

I am frustrated because I'm on my second stick which not boot either my EeePC or a 4-year-old Dell laptop.
I got the first one from erikos at FOSDEM (an SD card) and the second I downloaded today and used the Fedora Windows utility (a DiskOnKey USB stick).
In both cases, I correctly set the BIOS to boot from USB. But I only get to the end of the Fedora 10 blue & white bars, then see:
<snip>
WARNING: Cannot find root file system!
Create symlink /dev/root and then exit this shell to continue
the boot sequence
bash: no job control in this shell
bash-3.2#
</snip>
Both of these machines have AZERTY keyboards, could that be a factor?
Any help appreciated.

Minimal configurations
Fedora is supporting i5/i6 Pentium machines (they built the binaries
for such machines). As far as memory, for Sugar, I think our
experience suggests a minimum of 256MB of DRAM. The Sugar image is
small but Fedora standards, but we haven't done much work in trying to
squeeze it down too much (~400 MB). If you wanted to run from RAM, I
would guess a minimum of 1GB would be necessary, but I don't know of
anyone who has tried it. As far as drivers, we are not shipping
drivers that aren't normally shipped with Fedora, but you can install
additional drivers, e.g., Broadcom, from the Terminal activity within
Sugar itself.
Please report back your actual experiences from the field.
No luck with MacBook
Boots with CD-ROM helper, displays SUGAR logo, some dots, the OLPC logo, more dots, all good, but when black desktop appears there is only a white rectangle at the upper-left and the mouse pointer looks like a series of short horizontal lines. Video is Intel GMA 950. (July 16, 2009)
