This page is a draft of a work plan for Spring Intern from Harvard Graduate School of Education: Terri Singleton:
Main Goals

Implicit Goals

  * Create a feedback mechanism between the deployments with experience using Sugar and the PD
  * Create materials that feature Sugar being used around the world to foster a feeling in workshop participants of being part of a global community 
  * Help expand our grassroots community to include more teachers 
  * Provide an entrance path into the Sugar community that is not Open Source Computer Geek, thus bringing a diversity of gender and viewpoints to our community.
Intern Responsibilities
