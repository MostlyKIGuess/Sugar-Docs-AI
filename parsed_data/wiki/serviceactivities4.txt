Notes
To add your activity bundle to
aslo-v4
, you need to be a member of the
sugardl
group.
Then, copy your bundle to
/srv/activities-v4/bundles
, for example:
rsync dist/Pippy-17.xo user@sunjammer.sugarlabs.org:/srv/activities-v4/bundles/
 
 # optionally, generate metadata and copy to the same directory
# add a link to source code repository
 git config --get remote.origin.url > org.laptop.Pippy.git
 
 # get a list of authors of the activity
 git log -P --pretty=format:"%an" > org.laptop.Pippy.log
# copy them to sunjammer's bundles/metadata directory
 rsync org.laptop.Pippy.* user@sunjammer.sugarlabs.org:/srv/activities-v4/bundles/metadata/
 
 # trigger a new build of aslo-v4
 rebuild-aslo
Deploy directory:
/srv/www-sugarlabs/v4-activities
Source directory:
/srv/activities-v4/src
Bundle (*.xo) directory:
/srv/activities-v4/bundles
Upgrade notes
As
activities-v4
user on
Machine/sunjammer
, do
~/bin/also-refresh-src
 ~/bin/aslo-rebuild
This will pull
master
from the
source repository
, and the python library will be installed to
~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages
. Once this has been done, it will be accessible from any directory.
~/bin/aslo-rebuild
will rebuild v4.activities.sugarlabs.org, and deploy it to
/srv/www-sugarlabs/v4-activities
. This is only recommended if the user is
activities-v4
. For all other cases, please use
rebuild-aslo -> /usr/local/bin/rebuild-aslo
and
source-update-aslo -> /usr/local/bin/source-update-aslo
for rebuilding and updating the source code.
ASLO-v4 also maintains host specific configuration in
/srv/activities-v4/etc
which is maintained in a git repository. To make changes, add yourself to the
activities-v4
group and commit your changes.
