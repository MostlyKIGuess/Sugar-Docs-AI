website
So, we've made some good progress on the website in a few ways:
One is that we're actually working to improve the website, which is great because we were a bit deadlocked for a while
Another is that we're starting to build some better habits. The old code was hard because of customization. We're starting to put that into new files to keep track of it.
Finally, we're starting to get some content onto the website, remove broken links (and one-degree-removed-from broken links), and generally restructure the website a bit better
Once we get things to a good place we'll need to decide whether we want to keep using Jekyll or move to something else, but, after speaking to parents, teachers, and potential donors, I felt that it was urgent to get things "making sense" (even if not "perfect")
We could use some help on some things, such as review of our FAQs. Also, Devin has been collecting some "style guide" items that will need review at some point (basically a guide to help us get our public-facing language more consistent).
