Title: Sugar on a Stick/sdm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal
Enable autodetection of
SoaS
flash drives on
SoaS-helper
machines. (SoaS-helper was described in detail in
this blog post
)
Ideally, the
S
oas
D
esktop
M
anager
should:
Start on boot when a -helper machine loads
Provide a helpful and simple user interface
Detect all versions of SoaS drives and update them if outdated
Handle failures gracefully
Prepare the system enviornment to allow the user to continue where they left off
Detection tools
Since we lack a better heuristic, we will attempt to use the following criteria for our definition of a SoaS disk:
The device is a removable media, such as SD, USB-flash, or MMC
The device is FAT formatted
The device contains a magic-file (to-be-determined) which identifies it as a SoaS disk
Unfortunately, this requires us to mount each candidate disk inserted into the computer, which slows reaction time.
