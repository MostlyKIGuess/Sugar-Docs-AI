Platform: SOAS
Download the SOAS 0.110 image
Mount a usb drive with minimum 4GB capacity, more is better. Backup as needed, it will be erased.
Find out the path to the device. One method is to use df -h. Be careful to identify the usb stick, 
e.g. /dev/sdb1 - check its size to match the size of the stick. A partition of 7.3GB might be shown for an 8GB stick.
Platform: Raspberry Pi 3
Platform: Raspberry Pi 2
copy the SOAS image to the stick with the dd command:
dd if= ~/Downloads/Fedora-SoaS-Live-x86_64-24-20160614.n.0.iso of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4M
Mount the stick on your computer and reboot. It should boot to Sugar.
