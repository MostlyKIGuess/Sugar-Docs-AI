Introduction
The Browse activity is based on
XULRunner
the Mozilla runtime package. It does provide the user with nearly the same functionality that Firfox offers but tries to be clear and simple UI wise given the target audience. It also offers collaboration as one of it's main features.

What is new for users
Right click palettes have been improved with clearer text and icons. Keeping a file to the Journal now uses its file name as the Journal entry (the full download URL is placed in the description metadata), and uploading files to web servers also now uses the title, along with MIME logic for deciding a file extension (if no valid extension is provided in the title).
Right click palettes have been improved for clearer easier use.

Compatibility
The 0.86 version has no backwards compatibility, since it depends on the 0.86 platform (hulahop).

What is new for users
Tomeu Vizoso added new options to the palette. When you click on a link you have the option to download it.
The palette offers also an option to download an image, for reuse with your favorite image processing activity. Just click on the image you want to download and access it from the Journal.
Martin Langhoff has been adding functionality to authenticate with the Schoolserver. When registered with the server an HTTP Cookie is created to ease the use of services on the Schoolserver in future sessions.
Thanks to Daniel Drake Browse propagates the current locale now. This helps to use web services and pages in your mother language. Try it out with the addons page for example.
