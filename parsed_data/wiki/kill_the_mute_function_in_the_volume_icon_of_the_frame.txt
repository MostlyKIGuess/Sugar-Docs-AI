Description of Feature Request
Kill the Mute Function in the Volume icon of the frame.
Proposed Fix
Remove the Button response of the speaker icon in the location (extensions/deviceicon/speaker.py).
Result of Fix
On clicking the speaker icon in the frame, the speaker palette pops up, no effect on the level of sound. The image below shows the effect when the mouse has been released after the click and initially the sound was on.
