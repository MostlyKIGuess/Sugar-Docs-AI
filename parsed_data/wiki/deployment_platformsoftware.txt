Software Map
The whole software within the Harmonic Distribution is structured as:
Base software
Provided from
Sweets Distribution
in form of native packages. Base software is separated by targeted audience:
Using oriented
For regular usage. This kind of software exists in two dimensions:
By purpose:
Client side
Desktop
- Desktop Environment for Sugar Learning Platform.
Server side
Server Kit
- to form school servers.
By the supporting time:
Short-term support
(STS)
Targeting to individual usage and based on Sucrose six months release cycle.
Long-term support
(LTS)
Targeting to Sugar deployments that can't switch between Sucrose releases every six months.
Development oriented
Doers' Kit
- targeting to developers who code within the Sugar Learning Platform.
Community software
The rest of software created on top of the Base one. In contrast to the Base, this kind of software is being provided via
Sugar Network
.
Sweets Distribution
This is a 3rd party repository with Base Software packages built against all
supported platforms
. These packages are being built on Sugar Labs instance of
Open Build Service
and formed in several projects:
SweetsDistribution
Contains all
supported platforms
as OBS repositories and system packages for upstream projects (not Base software) that are not well packages in supported platforms.
SweetsDistribution:Factory
OBS project with development packages that are intended for testing only.
SweetsDistribution:<SUCROSE-RELEASE>

The high-level overview is looks like:
software creators
upload source bundles to the
Sugar Network
; only sources, even if it is binary based activities;
Sugar Network
if uploaded software needs building, it will send it to OBS;
on users side
Sweets library will:
read
Sugar Network
to find out information about implementations of software that user requested to launch;
according to the local environment, it will download proper implementation;
if there is no proper binary implementation, it will download sources and will build them in local environment.
