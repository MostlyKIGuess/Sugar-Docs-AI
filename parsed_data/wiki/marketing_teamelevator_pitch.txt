Building the Perfect Pitch
We need to be able to describe, in 75 persuasive words or less, to any possible listener, why Sugar matters.  It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it.  :)
The goal of the elevator pitch is to elicit the magical words:
tell me more
.
Rules
Here are the rules:
Got a pitch that's 75 words or less?  Put it under "current elevator pitches", note the word count, and associate your wikiname with it.
Like a pitch?  Put a +1 under it with your wikiname attached.  For now, PICK ONLY ONE.
Want to reword a pitch?  Great!  Copy it and add your changes.  DO NOT just change the pitch in place.  Create a new one.
Don't +1 multiple pitches.  That's cheating.  If there are two you like, munge them into one.  :)
Making good pitches
The best pitches start with a hook aimed at some concern of the person listening. For liberals, save the world. For hard-headed business types, talk about creating new markets. For social conservatives, talk about home schooling. Better still is a pitch that invites the hearer to express a concern that you can follow up on. We will need a whole
Frequently Expressed Concerns
list.

Did you ever have an experience as a kid that opened up your world and made you feel like you could change it when you grew up? That's the kind of moment we want every kid to have - except we think that, with the right tools and opportunities, they don't need to wait to grow up to be able to change their world. (64 words)

Have you heard of the One Laptop per Child project? Sugar is the learning platform developed for OLPC. It was developed by the MIT Media Lab and was developed especially for collaboration and creative learning and elementary aged children.  We are putting it on machines everywhere, netbooks, desktops, even on bootable USB sticks, so that every child can learn use Sugar anywhere.
