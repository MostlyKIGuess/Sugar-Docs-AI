Hi everyone,
I am Rahul Bothra (pro-panda).
My contributions,
Active code contributor
; also working on
Port to Python 3
project
Code reviewer
and activity maintainer
GSoC' 18 student and GCI' 18 mentor
I am excited by our goals and our potential, but I am also concerned that we are functioning in an inefficient manner.
Currently in the SLOB meetings,
A lot of the members are inactive. They don't attend the SLOB meetings or reply to motions, crippling our progress.
We don't have a concrete plan of our goals. We try to cover a lot of breath in our efforts, and end up working on things which are not related to our goals (eg: Sugar Social)
We drag work for a lot of time, (eg: ASLO v3) a direct result of inactive mentoring and checks during GSoC
Lack of concern about the number of developers working on Sugar and its activities. We are failing in attracting new consistent developers for it, despite being a popular organisation in the Google programs.
The selection of mentors and organisation admins for Google programs is a closed process.
What I will undertake once elected:
Attend every SLOB meeting regularly
Revamping how we conduct GCI and GSoC to attract more contributions as well as improve the quality of mentoring; making sure we prioritise tasks which are more important to us, adding more checks before adding developers, grooming of every task / project before it is added / selected.
Make a clear roadmap of our goals for the next 2 years in each domain of code, outreach, design and content. Start towards implementation of those goals according to priority.
Make sure everything (except any decision concerning only the board) are taken publicly and in an open environment
