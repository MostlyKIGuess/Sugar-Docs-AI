Under a tree
you need two computers with wireless capabilities
on machine A reveal the palette of the network device (in the frame at the bottom) and click 'Create Network'
a network item called "<your name>'s Network" is added in the neighborhood view
on machine B connect to this network
verify that both machines are connected to the same network; the network device is in connected state and both machines are in the same IP range (listed in the device item's palette)
Internet Connection sharing
you need two computers with wireless capabilities; one needs to either have a second wireless interface or a wired network interface; furthermore you need a wireless or wired connection to the internet
connect the machine with two interfaces to your internet connection
create on that machine an ad hoc network as well
connect on the other machine (B) to that ad hoc network
machine B should be able to use the internet connection of machine A; use for example the Browse activity to verify this.
