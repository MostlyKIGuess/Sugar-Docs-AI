The Education team needs more teachers to get involved.
Getting involved in the Education Team (Please add your ideas):
write a lesson plan that shows how Sugar can be used to enhance a learning experience
post it in or link to it from the wiki
describe a favorite lesson plan
write a Sugar Activity (we'll help you)
or write a critique of Sugar or a Sugar Activity (and give feedback to the developers)
add to our collective knowledge about technology and learning
blog about Sugar
add to our bibliography
help a Sugar deployment
visit a Sugar deployment
and support teachers using Sugar
help with evaluation
contribute or mentor in a project like
Math4 Team
better yet: do you own Sugar deployment
