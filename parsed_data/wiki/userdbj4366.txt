About
I'm a 5th year RIT student majoring in Computer Networking, but I enjoy programming and would like to help this project in any way I can.
I graduated from FLCC with a 2 year degree in CS (mostly Java), so I don't know anything about Python, but I like programming and would like to learn Python. I also like math so I hope to be able to find some way to contribute to this project and have fun doing it!
:(
I recently learned that the buy-one get-one deal for the XO expired at the end of last year so I can't even buy one!
Development Interests
In specific, I like geometry so I'm interested in any of the 4.G.* areas on the
Curriculum_Chart
page.
