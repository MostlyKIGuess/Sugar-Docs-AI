Sugar Digest
1.
Google Code-In
begins tomorrow. It is not too late to
sign up as a mentor
and to
recruit students to participate
. While many of
the tasks
involve programming, there are also documentation, design, and research tasks. This is a great opportunity for Sugar Labs to recruit its next generation of developers.
2. Sugar Labs is holding its annual election to the oversight board early next month. If you are interested in running for one of the open board seats, open to any community member, please feel free to contact me or the membership committee with any questions before 7 December.
Tech Talk
3. Daniel Narvaez has made a number of improvements to
sugar-build
, which has by-and-large replaced sugar-jhbuild as the preferred development environment for Fedora and Ubuntu.
