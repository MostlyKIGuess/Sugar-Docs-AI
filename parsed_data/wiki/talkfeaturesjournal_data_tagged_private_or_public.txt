Design ideas
Consider a 'school' tag alone.  The school server could be configured to only backup or archive items with this tag. Views could include or exclude school-tagged items. De-selecting the school tag would return the item to the general category.
The visual interface effecting the selection is critical. For example, the single tag could toggle visually between the school icon and the general learner icon, or just show the school icon when selected and show blank (general) when not.
An additional 'private' tag may be valuable for other uses, but may be confusing for the above purpose.
