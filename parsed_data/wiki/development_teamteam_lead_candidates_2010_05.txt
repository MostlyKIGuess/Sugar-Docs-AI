Aleksey Lim
The only (since other Team Lead duty is coordination and I don't feel ourself ready for such work) purpose for my nomination was
changing
some basic things of how sugar core team should work, at the end I'm sure it is not-right-moment/not-right-at-all because could only stress development team, and on other side, interested developers can already take part in this work and I hope to have something useful for other people in nearest future.
