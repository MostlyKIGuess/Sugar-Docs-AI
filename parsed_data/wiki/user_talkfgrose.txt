Wiki education and team coordinator identification
As you discovered, I had thought it best to identify the Wiki team coordinator on BOTH the main Wiki page and the Wiki Team page. I respect your decision to void the former. In your place, I might be tempted to follow your example if I wanted to reduce contacts from new visitors who might solve whatever problem they had simply by doing more work. If they fail, now they finally DO have the ultimate ability to discover the identity of the coordinator - from the Wiki Team page.
But please consider linking from
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Welcome_to_the_Sugar_Labs_wiki
to both a gentle introduction to the concept of a Wiki (e.g. the Commoncraft tutorial at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY
) and the article at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki
Thanks for your diligence and kindly civility.

thx for cleaning up my post
as i saw that your are editing the discussion page of "get sugar", i wanted to thank you for your help!
at the moment im just reading in the sugarlabs wiki, what do you think of a single page dedicated to "install sugar (fedora 11 with gnome) on olpc"?
i think i will be able to rewrite the version on the discussion page plus adding a few aspects.
thx again for your help,
canin

I noticed you're doing an enormous amount of work on the wiki.  Thanks!

table of contents
I wonder if we could configure mediawiki to always display the content table on the right instead of littering all the pages with the same directive?

I haven't found anything like that yet.  It's better as the template call than the full instruction:
{| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="clear:right; margin-bottom: .5em; float: right; padding: .5em 0 .8em 1.4em; background: none; width: {{{1|auto}}};"
| __TOC__
|}<noinclude>
[[Category:TOC templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]
</noinclude>

Add in Mediawiki:common.css
#toc { float: right } --

Many thanks for your help.  I think this information about AFP should be available through a link somewhere on this wiki.  If you let me know where it should go, I'll take a stab at putting it in.

Done!  At least it's a start.

Custom cursors in vector.css
Would you be willing to remove the custom cursors you added in
MediaWiki:Vector.css
? They look cute, but harm the usability of the site; they show up as large and clunky on many desktop browsers, and make it hard to select text and click precisely (particularly on Google Chrome). Thanks,

See
Wiki Team/Resources/Remove Sugar Cursors
for a workaround.
