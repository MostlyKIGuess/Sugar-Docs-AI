Notes
Cleaning user database
To remove inactive accounts (i.e. ones that have never been confirmed or marked as spammers):
sqlite3 /srv/socialhelp/tracproject/db/trac.db
DELETE FROM session WHERE length(sid)Â != 24 AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM permission WHERE username = sid);
Upgrade notes
Edit the Dockerfile (stored in /home/sam/trac or from the
github repository
) to include the latest version of Trac (eg. change the version numbers)
container.yml start /home/sam/trac -d
