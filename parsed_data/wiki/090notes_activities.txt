Dr. Geo is an interactive geometry activity. Dr. Geo allows one to create geometric figure plus the interactive manipulation of such figure in respect with their geometric constraints. It is usable in teaching situation with students from primary or secondary level. It is simple and effective with some unique features as scripting and Smalltalk programming.
