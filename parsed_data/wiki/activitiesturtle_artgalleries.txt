A clock activity
Tony Forster describes his "adventures" with on-the-fly definitions to create an
analog clock
in
his blog.

library functions, e.g.,
localtime().tm_min
sin(x) + sin(pi/2)
Sensors
Turtle Art supports sensor input:
Using a Hall-effect sensor, you can build a bike odometer in Turtle Art
sound paint
Capturing mouse events and using audio to set the pen width
Reading data from multiple sensors (XO hardware only)
love speaks volumes
A heart that beats according to sensor input
