Help wanted
Contact
us if you would like to help maintaining existing
services or setting up new ones.
Sugar Labs sysadmins are generally required to send a GPG signed copy of USENIX's
SAGE System Administrators' Code of Ethics
before taking service.
We coordinate mostly through #sugar on Freenode,
and the
Systems mailing-list
.
We also have occasional
team meetings
on #sugar-meeting, usually announced in advance on the list.
See
Infrastructure Team/TODO
for a list of tasks we need to get done.
Volunteer responsibly!
Contributors of free software projects are not generally expected a minimum level of performance.
However, maintaining infrastructure is a job of high responsibility. The fact that you're not being
paid does not mean that it's OK to abandon your post without notice!
If you choose to maintain or co-maintain a piece of the Sugar Labs infrastructure, you agree to:
Assume
full personal responsibility
for the performance and security of your service
Take reasonable steps to
avoid the risk of data loss and downtime
Keep the corresponding
Service
or
Machine
documentation page up to date
Try to
respond quickly
to problems reported by users
When you no longer have time,
step down responsibly
: find a new maintainer and help them take over your duties smoothly
If that is not possible, clearly announce that the service is being discontinued and
help cleanup
all resources used by it.
Remember,
"with great power comes great responsibility!"
