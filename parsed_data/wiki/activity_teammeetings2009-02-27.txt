Friday Feburary 27 2009 - 12pm EST
Agenda
Catch up on the past month's progress
activities.sugarlabs.org discussion
Identify major issues that block usage by all activity maintainers and/or consumers.
Make a clear HOWTO about uploading a bundle, nominating it, etc. Could be a guide with screenshots or a screencast, etc (I think that David Farning is looking at this)
Set up a team of administrators and a team of editors. I guess a couple of people in each could be a good start.
Status of activity migration + author outreach
Review of the TODO list
Distribution discussion
Minimum resolution supported by Sugar
Help system
News from Tuesday's OLPC Deployment meeting.

I forgot to use #endmeeting, so this log contains quite a bit of additional unrelated discussion.
