SOAS Deployement Settings Definition
In case of a deploy in a school we could not expect children or teacher to spend a large initial amount of time to set up basic paramenters for SOAS usage (es. LANGUAGE, Timezone, Keyboard).
Whatever approach would be taken in order to land those initial dsettings in the sticks/images, the very first step is to try ti define with increasing precision what  all those settings are, where a deployer or developer could find them and how to operate changes without creating regression errors in the procedure.
In order to support deployements activities the standard SOAS image should allow a limited degree of personalization for basic settings. 

This page would be the start of a documentation effort aimed to document those basic interfaces:
* to ease the personalization efforts from field organizations
* to avoid regression issues related to personalization done in the wrong places
A basic list of setting to be descripted could be taken from
