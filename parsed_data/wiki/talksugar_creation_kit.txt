Missing "people" link on Blue header bar
http://people.sugarlabs.org/
I intentionally removed this because it is unstructured and totally confusing to newcomers. If there is content there that is useful, it needs direct linking.

I keep getting a "Missing Plugins" message on my firefox on this page. It is quite anoying. Can it be supressed (None is found to be available) (Using TrimSlice H250 arm Ubuntu 11.04) --

Split Sugar Creation Kit page
This project page has grown to encompass far more than its original scope.  Many find this single page overwhelming for such a broad scope.  The embedded navigation (outside of the table of contents, such as for the tutorials) adds to the complexity.
the extra information is good to have,
and it needs to be integrated into the wiki.
It is recommended that the authors spend considerable time breaking out (and refreshing) sections of information into separate wiki pages (usually not under the Sugar Creation Kit hierarchy) so that the main project page serves as an annotated index to the other primary pages.
For example, the tutorial pages should stand on their own (where the special navigation links may be explored as tools for convenient reading).
Others may have more suggestions for sections or topics to split off from this main page, and could offer them by adding to this listing.  --

Quote, FGrose, "usually not under the Sugar Creation Kit hierarchy". Is it unreasonable to increase the heirarchy?
An increase in the hierarchy would be reasonable as long as it is limited to the scope of Sugar Creation Kit.  Sugar Creation Kit is defined as a DVD containing all the resources required to create Sugar on a Stick without requiring Internet access or the online references to those and other resources to make it easy to download and create one's own DVD of resources for offline creation of Sugar.
"Sugar Creation" is the scope of the entire Sugar Labs wiki.  The "Sugar Creation Kit" is a tool to facilitate that for those with Internet connectivity limitations.  Of course, everything that is valuable in an offline setting is valuable in the online setting, as well.  So the principal value of Sugar Creation Kit wiki content comes from its annotated organization of web content.  (The 04 January 2011 date for the DVD suggests that the online version is used primarily as an annotated index and rarely for composing a DVD.)
The current SCK hierarchy contains original content that should stand independently or elsewhere within the Sugar Labs wiki.  Some examples of this are the Tutorials, Sugar in Virtualization, Sugar on a Stick/Version history, and Raspberry pi pages.
Other pages within SCK would better serve all readers if they were directly associated with the original topic pages.  This can be accomplished through the use of the wiki subpage and transclusion tools.  Use of these tools also works to reduce redundancy (from copying content), which helps to maintain currency of the wiki as only a single source needs to be updated as information changes.  By following these principles, over time, the wiki becomes more sustainable and accessible, as a topic's history is in one place, and there is less fragmented and conflicting information.
It may take a bit of time and editing history to recognize those topic sections that fit this publishing model.  One immediate benefit is seen by including a ==Subpages index== section to significant pages, which will
automatically
update as new subpages are created. (See
Sugar Network
or
Platform Team/Harmonic Distribution
, for example.) --

In order for Sugar Creation Kit to remain an accessible source of all types of Sugar image files, we might group these sub pages under [Sugar Creation Kit/Sources].
See recent edits to
Emulator image files
for an example of how the subpage transclusion model is used to maintain topic organization and potentially annotated summaries with reuse instead of copying sources.  --
FGrose

An aspect of Sugar Creation Kit is the testing function. The classification [Sugar Creation Kit/Testing] might invite contributions, while pages in this section would be more easily recognised as expired as time goes by.
Testing of the variety of Sugar Activities and full distribution images seems to fit the subpage transclusion model with /Testing subpages.  Collective testing summaries and work pages are important independent topics (perhaps worthy of a Testing Team page set), which are generally outside of the 'SCK proper' scope.  --

Plan is to Link to these pages and remove this content from this page.
Sugar_Creation_Kit/sck/Sugar-on-a-Stick
Sugar_Creation_Kit/sck/Sugar-in-Virtualization
Sugar_Creation_Kit/sck/Activities
Sugar_Creation_Kit/sck/References
That's a good start (see the comments on each of the new talk pages).  When these are done, you should have ideas for more splitting.  --

Will it be renamed to existing link?
Will the old page be archivedÂ ?
I may have to do a lot of adjusting of links once this is done.
Tom Gilliard
When you are ready, just copy the full page contents of SCK-2 over the contents of
Sugar Creation Kit
. The history of both pages are maintained, although you may want to delete the SCK-2 working page when it has finished serving its purpose.  You should also adjust the links before or during the copy to provide a cleaner transition. --

Community distributions
Please don't create yet another listing of community distributions.
Note:
The contents of this section have been transcluded from another page,
Talk:Supported distributions
:
Talk:Supported distributions
Please work to update
Supported systems
turning it into an index to the
Community/Distributions
subpages, which should each be moved to a top level page. --

Inkyfingers
19:14, 27 June 2012 (EDT)
I'd rather stick with the titled concept, the shorter subset of supported systems/distributions, as opposed to a long list of unsupported ones. (A link to the DistroWatch list could be included for those curious about the scope of distributions and as part of a definition of what a distribution is.) --
FGrose
19:38, 27 June 2012 (EDT)
Sure, it would be edited down to the correct number of distros (as an index, easily enlargeable), but is this what you mean by "top level page"? --
Inkyfingers
19:45, 27 June 2012 (EDT)
Yes, for example,
Community/Distributions/Ubuntu
would be moved (using the wiki move page link) to
Ubuntu
, replacing the redirect that is there now. --

How do you feel about a "clean page start", a pure index of
Supported distributions
? --
Inkyfingers
20:04, 27 June 2012 (EDT)
That sounds reasonable.
Supported distributions
can be an annotated index, useful for transclusion to other pages such as
Downloads#Do you use GNU/Linux?
and
Sugar Creation Kit#Community Distributions A Complete Listing
;
Ways to run Sugar
could hold the introductory sections;
Updating Sugar
could hold general guidance on that process.  They can stand independently, or be composed by transclusion into
Supported systems
or
Systems that run Sugar
. All these pages should be targeted primarily for non-developers, but with guidance that serves as a primer for curious and developing minds. --

The downside of distributions pages being top level pages is that they (and their child pages) cannot then be collected together automatically.  I have added the Community/Distributions SubPage index to
Supported systems
, to demonstrate a different approach. If the distro-specific material currently in
Supported systems
could all be updated into correct distro page, would the resulting
Supported systems
page be useful? --
Inkyfingers
22:29, 29 June 2012 (EDT)
Yes, temporarily; but please design
Supported distributions
to be transcluded in place of the sections mentioned above. Each supported distribution page can also be categorized as such and then collected in a Category page.  The Special:PrefixIndex page is useful as an interim list, but suffers because it cannot be formatted, annotated, logo-ized, or reordered, such as by completeness and currency of Sugar support, like the proposed replacement.  --

Why not just link to the Community Distributions wiki pages links shown on the SCK page,
Linux Distributions where sugar is available
? Why reinvent the wheel? I feel that this listing on SCK (which is almost all the result of my investigation) is important to be left alone on the SCK page. --
Satellit

Please understand that the wiki allows
mediawikiwiki:Transclusion
of whole pages (with some adjustments, which are convenient only for reusing one part of a page).  Also note the publishing and maintenance goals to reduce redundancy described in
the call to reorganize the SCK page
. If
Linux Distributions where sugar is available
is the best listing, it can be integrated to serve the full wiki, as in this demonstration,
Supported distributions
