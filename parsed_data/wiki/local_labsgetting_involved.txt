There are a number of Local Sugar Labs around the world, and there is sure to be a Lab near you soon.
Local Labs vary dramatically in their interests and goals. Some local labs support sugar deployments, whereas other local labs want to provide translations for Sugar in their language. A local lab may want to provide support, particularly if that support is for a non-English language. Whatever the direction of the group, the majority of Local Labs are eager to expand what they do, and if they don't do what you want, maybe you can help them move in that direction?
Finding a local lab
To find a Local to join, take a look at the
Local Labs#Local Labs Directory
and see if there is one in your area. Remember that local labs are often based around a country or state, so although there may be a lab specifically in your area, the lab for your country or state is the team you should join.
If you find a local lab near you, join it.
Joining a local lab
To join the lab, simply join the labs's mailing list or IRC channel and say you would like to get involved. You are sure to get a warm welcome by the team and you are all set to go. There is no payment or initiation to go through, just talking and being with the team is considered being a member! :)
If you can't find a local lab near you, create one.
Creating a local lab
Creating a Local Lab is an exciting, challenging and rewarding experience. A successful local lab can have a great impact, both locally and globally.
Forming a local lab is not about forming a group and telling people what to do.  It is about identifying local needs and inspiring smart and passionate people to meet those needs. Running a local lab will push you to your limits. You will need to keep the group organized and resolve conflict where required.
Getting Started
First, you will need to chose your region.  A local local lab can support a city, a state, or even a country.  We encourage you to start with country sized regions until you grow large enough that separate, smaller teams would be more effective.
Next, you will need to identify a contact person. Your contact person will be the ambassador between Sugar Labs and your local lab.
