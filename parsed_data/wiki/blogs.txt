lifestream
Lifestream is a plugin built on top of the WordPress platform. It allows you to effortlessly integrate your social network activity across the web with your blog.Out of the box, Lifestream is just streams in RSS/Atom feeds and prettying them up, but deep down it's a very flexible platform allowing developers to integrate any kind of activity they desire.
eurekastreams
As an enterprise knowledge worker using Eureka Streams, you can build a personal profile and activity stream. Use your profile to share information about your skills and background, and your stream to post messages and links related to work.
Group streams provide teams and communities with the ability to generate conversation around events that are critical to their performance or objective. By capturing these events in the stream, team and community members can use a keyword search to quickly access information and make informed decisions.
The activity page and the start page provide knowledge workers with a simple, yet powerful, set of capabilities used to view and manage the information within Eureka Streams to make more effective decisions. On your activity page, you can view all employee and group streams you are following and easily group and filter your streams to fit your work style.
The start page is your own personal homepage. You can customize it with apps that display streams of activity or news feeds from both external and internal sources.

Facebook
is perhaps somewhat controversial, but...
There is a Facebook group page for Sugar

that could use some love.
Dailymotion
is a place where we had been accumulating Sugar videos (in part because they accept .ogv).
Not sure we ever properly set up our channel but see
