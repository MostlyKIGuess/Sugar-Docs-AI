TrimSlice H250: Ubuntu on a SDXC Card
http://trimslice.com/web/trim-slice-h-specifications
This is a workaround as the Trimslice OS installers do NOT make a bootable HD on the TrimSlice H 250 (even though it appears to have done so)
I used a 160 GB HD- Worked on 320 GB HD (see above)--

This is based on the fact that The installer-ubuntu-natty-2.6.38.3_l4t.r1.01.img is a working Ubuntu install
Note: Running from the SanDisk (30MB/s) Ultra 64 GB SDXC seems faster than either the Internal HD in the TrimSlice H250 or the ssd in the TrimSlicePro
In the TrimSlice H250 Ubuntu Desktop:
