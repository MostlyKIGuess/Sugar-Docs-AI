Hi Tomeu,
can we get the design discussion going and then describe a bit more the feature. Would be nice to have a mockup as well.
Have asked in the mailing list.

It is not clear that list vs random is the real issue. Wasn't there a proposal to position based on some hash so that icons would keep a consistent position on the screen? That coupled with Search might be enough. But nothing wrong with a list view, of course. --

Maybe this feature should be renamed "Make presence UI scale better", though that may be more of a goal than a feature that can be delivered in a single milestone. Simon has proposed a feature for fixed positioning in the free-form view already, but this one will focus on the list view. List views are important because allow the user to examine sets of objects that are too big to represent in a single screen. Also, allow for keyboard navigation and use facilities in Gtk+ that plug into the accessibility framework. I also hope that having one more list view in the shell will help people distinguish the activity list from the journal list view.
