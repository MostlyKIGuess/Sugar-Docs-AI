Fedora on an OLPC XO
On an OLPC XO-1 laptop, run olpc-update as root.
Normally you only need to run
olpc-update
in the Terminal application with a build number, like this:
# sudo olpc-update 767
Note:
Now you can do this by means of the graphical
Sugar Control Panel
.
Joyride
See
OLPC:Future releases
, the Joyride train is in the round house.
Joyride is for developers; it is not supported. Joyride builds may cause data corruption and in rare cases, even cause hardware damage, so please do not use Joyride on mission-critical systems.
Joyride contains all the "bleeding-edge" features that are being debugged for inclusion in the next release.
Open the Terminal application and type the following, substituting 2469 for the latest version number.
# olpc-update joyride-2469
What's the latest version?
You can find the latest build number (shown above as 1779) at the bottom of
http://xs-dev.laptop.org/~cscott/xo-1/streams/joyride/
Updates usually takes 10â€“15 minutes. It's advised that you plug your XO in while Sugar updates itself, then reboot it to see the new OS take effect.
