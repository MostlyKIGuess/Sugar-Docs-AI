Feature process
The feature process for Sugar on a Stick aims at providing a structured way of implementing and keeping track of upcoming features for the next release of Sugar on a Stick. This document outlines the guidelines for submitting feature proposals. An important thing to realize is the release schedule for each release.
What is a feature?
A feature is defined as a significant change or enhancement to the version of Sugar on a Stick currently under development that may or may not include new packages and also relate to features of both Fedora and Sugar
What are the deadlines?
The deadlines for the release currently under development are outlined in the
release schedule
.
What do I get with a feature?
Having your feature approved not only helps everybody involved in the development and engineering process to keep track of its state, but also allows other teams - like the
marketing team
- to leverage your work and promote it.
What are my responsibilities?
By signing up for a feature, you sign up for taking care of it. That means you'll be the one responsible for providing updates and interacting with the different teams concerned by your feature, like the release engineering for Sugar on a Stick. It does, however, not mean that you've to realize your feature all alone - go out and tell the
lists
and the
planet
about your work. Get people excited to help you!
How does evaluation happen?
Your proposal needs a majority of
YAY
votes from the release team (determined for a given release by the release manager - the v4 release manager is Sebastian Dziallas, and the current relase team is formed by Peter Robinson, Mel Chua and Sebastian Dziallas) to get approval. Discussion will happen at a weekly meeting, while the decisions will be announced to the SoaS mailing list.
What if my feature got rejected?
No worries! Features that are originally rejected can be revised and resubmitted.
How to submit a feature for consideration
Fill out the
template
and stick it on a page in the wiki. (
TODO:
create
Category:SoaS_v4_Feature
so people can make their pages belong to the appropriate category so that we know which version you're targeting ).
Place a link to your proposal in the
#Current feature ideas
section of this page while you're working on the document.
Send an email to the SoaS
list
and incorporate any feedback you might receive.
When you think your feature proposal is ready, move it to the
#Features submitted for review
section of this page. It will be brought up at the next
Sugar on a Stick meeting
, where it'll be evaluated and voted on. We might ask you to make further adjustments and revisit it at a later point or approve the feature directly. We're looking forward to hearing about your ideas!
Approved features for the current release
Features must be added to this list by a member of the release team. Place complete feature proposals in the
#Features submitted for review
section for consideration at the next meeting.

Testing process
Our test process, which is under construction, will consist of the following:
An agreed-upon image each week for testers to attack (the daily build on $datetime of each week, for instance)
An agreed-upon set of test cases for them to execute (iow, the "test plan" thing we haven't had before)
An agreed-upon place and format for the results from running those test cases to be reported to
An agreed-upon $datetime each week by which all test results for that week will be submitted - so that the development team has a chance to look at those results and revise the build before the next test image goes out.
The first thing we are doing is getting a weekly image under test to automatically appear at a static link; see
#Test image
below. We are going to set up a cron job so the nightly build (from
http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/nightly-composes/soas/
- which we need to start up again from the Fedora side) grabs and archives the appropriate image-under-test each week.
The last weekly testing update was 6/21/2010:

The test image is the most recent
nightly build
as of 23:59:59 on the most recent Thursday. Past test images are available at

We do not yet have test cases. They will appear here when they are available.

Test results
A basic template for reporting simple smoke test results is
Testing/Activity Test Table
. This needs to be moved to a proper namespace, and instructions need to be written. Instructions will be listed here when they are available.
