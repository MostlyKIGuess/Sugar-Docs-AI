Much of the remainder of the meeting was in regard to the relationship between the engineering needs of OLPC and the long-term goals and the relationship to the learning community:
we applauded the efforts to reach out to the Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu communities and agreed that supporting these efforts will be instrumental in our ability to reach a broader user community;
we acknowledged the efforts to date and agreed there is a need for more focus on tools for "trying" Sugar, e.g., LiveCD, LiveUSB, etc.;
we bemoaned the fact that it has been difficult to find additional engineering resources for Sugarâ€”a priority;
we discussed some of the subsystems that are in need of attention: collaboration and datastore and agreed, in the case of the latter, to reach out to the GNOME community for help.
