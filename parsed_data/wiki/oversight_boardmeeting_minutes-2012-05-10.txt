Agenda
We discussed local labs and the possibility of setting up a new organization to support them.
Action items:
we solicit from the community things that would like from a New Org that have been difficult to achieve within the SFC framework
we look into existing orgs, e.g., OLE, from which we may model a New Org
we reconvene and pool our research results
if it seems rational and reasonable, we create New Org
