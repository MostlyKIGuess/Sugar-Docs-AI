Filling vacant board seat
Travel for Music Blocks workshop
Google Code In Update
Ignacio gave an update on GCI:
GCI 2017 has started, and so far, I think this is our most successful year
200 students have claimed tasks so far...
155 tasks has been completed so far (maybe a few more)
Filling vacant board seat
Walter raised the issue of having Claudia Urrea fill the vacant seat on the board. An
email motion
was made after the meeting because there was not a quorum.
Travel for Music Blocks workshop
Walter raised the issue of providing ~US $500 for local travel for two (or more) Music Blocks workshops that Devin Ulibarri will be conducting in Japan later this month. An
email motion
was made after the meeting because there was not a quorum.
