Web Services Coordination
Mission
What does the project do?
Provides a runtime for the web activity
Provides tools to build a web activity
Encourages feedback from web developers
Detects patterns between web activities and implement tools for shortcutting them.
Should the project encourage “good practices” ??
Vision
How will the world be better if the project succeeds?
Adopting web developers to build web activities
There is a growing world of amazing tools and libs for web development that could be exploited on web activities.
Smoothing the port of existing web apps to sugar (like games, etc)
Values
The foundation upon which integrity is based.
Be able to change and adapt fast without risk and losing quality
automated testing
code coverage
safe refactoring
Decision making should be done by measuring data and not by tastes and feelings
Framework should be easy to introduce to web developers
Impact
Where we want to be in two years?
???
Road Map
??
Project specification
?
Technical tasks which must be completed prior to final release
SourceMaps
osbuild webkitgtk version: 2.0.4
API doc (something like
http://usejsdoc.org
)
book reader as a QA cycle
Most of the problems were observed when rendering ebooks and navigating them.
The idea is to make a web activity using an existing ebook web reader.
How to do state persistence on web activities???
localStorage
datastore.js
dictstore.js
�
cycle a:
Current status of web activities (with sugar 0.100)
Simple web activities are able to be made
osbuild works well as devel environment on Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora18, but it lacks for well defined development flow
It’s possible to do some state persistence through js API, but there is no doc about it
SL discourages the use of x2js compilers (and minifiers) due to current webkitgtk does not support SourceMaps
WebCam support is unknown
To do
Documenting persistence API
Add support for Sugar 0.98 (?)
Define development flow for web activities
Add support for SourceMap
Research webcam support (try out HTML5, media access)
Documenting internationalization method
Make a porting of a GTK-based activity (ex.: BookReader)
