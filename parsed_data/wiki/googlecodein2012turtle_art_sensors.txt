Background
Activities/TurtleArt
is a visual programming language for children based on the LOGO language originally developed by Seymour Papert, Cynthia Solomon, et al. in the 1960s at BBN and MIT. Turtle Art is one of the ways in which we get children as young as five to six programming and debugging on the Sugar platform. Although we have
extensive pages
in the wiki describing Turtle Art, and some introductory tutorials
[1]
,
[2]
, and
[3]
, we are nonetheless lacking a basic introduction to the program, both for learners and teachers.
Turtle Art has support for working with sensor input. Tony Forster and Guzman Trindad have written up
extensive project notes
on their experiments. But it is more of a list than a manual or tutorial.
Task
Write a guide to Turtle Art with Sensors, drawing heavily upon
material in the wiki
and
Tony's blog
