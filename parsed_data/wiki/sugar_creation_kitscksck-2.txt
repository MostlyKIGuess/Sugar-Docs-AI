SoaS Installation variations
A collection of install methods
Installation_test_Cases
f17 Test Cases
Category:Live USB
A collection of links on how Live USB's are used in different distributions
A-Non-Live (real file structured) USB
This is an example of a dd writable SoaS-v2.img file which produces a fully functional Conventional install on a USB. This is equivalent to a liveinst install to USB.
It was first suggested by bernie in early 2010 as a better alternative to the currently used live USB SoaS file systems with their fragile and limited sized overlay,
This functionality is expected to be included in fedora 17.
This can also be realized by entering
"liveinst"
in root sugar terminal.
This is the
Anaconda
installer for live file systems which installs to the USB with a normal install.
Approximately 2 times as large a USB-stick is required (4GB minimum) as a compressed file system and an overlay are not used.
Notes on Live File Systems

Clarify writing ISO to USB
(Discussion on what is supported in fedora)
https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-qa/ticket/134
Technical Discussion of Live USB's:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_and_use_Live_USB#Data_Persistence
Limited Lifetime of Persistent Overlay
One very important note about using the "primary" persistent overlay for system changes is that due to the way it's currently implemented (as a LVM copy-on-write snapshot),
every single change to it (writes AND deletes) subtracts from its free space, so it will eventually be "used up" and your USB stick will no longer boot.
Because of these limitations, it is advisable to use the system-level persistence sparingly, for configuration changes and important security updates only.
For a truly persistent write-many (vs write-once) overlay, use the --home-size-mb option to create a home directory filesystem image for personal files.
Unlike the primary system overlay image, the home.img can be re-used and loop mounted outside of the liveusb environment.
Cautions with u3 USB sticks
USB sticks with u3 partition will not boot with liveusb-creator
CAUTION:
Formatting the USB-stick will not remove the hidden (virtual CD-ROM drive)
How to remove hidden u3 partition
Linux:
http://u3-tool.sourceforge.net/
Windoz: Insert u3 Stick then click on tray icon for u3; select delete u3 partition, once it is deleted the USB-stick will work with liveusb-creator

How to make your own custom Sugar-Creation_Kit.iso file
(How this DVD was converted to an .iso file)
Collect, annotate and sort the files you want in a folder on your Desktop.
Burn the contents of this folder to a CD or DVD.
Use the following command in Terminal as the root user:
dd if=/dev/sr0 of=Sugar-Creation-Kit.iso
/dev/sr0 is the device name for your DVD/CD drive
Sample output:
dd if=/dev/sr0 of=Sugar-Creation-Kit.iso
 5555584+0 records in
 5555584+0 records out
 2844459008 bytes (2.8 GB) copied, 232.86 s, 12.2 MB/s
the resulting .iso file can be sent over the internet or used to make copies by burning to a DVD
copy items between a USB drive and sugar-journal
copy files between the sugar-journal and a 2nd USB-stick

Translated from Spanish with google translate:
There is a special package for an existing program sugarizar X11 using a bash script and a library specially created for it,
here let the package be zipped for download:
Sugarizar_software.zip
Just unzip the file and run the script found in the package and you answering the questions,
the script will generate a directory with the activity for sugar, then you should give the required permissions to  each file and directory
as explained in the main page this site and package the directory
to download the activity from the x or directly copy the entire directory to / home / olpc / Activities on the XO.

  -H HASH, --hash=HASH  Use a specific checksum algorithm (default: sha1)
Installing and using liveusb-creator in sugar
An easy method for Fedora and Windows, however this method does not generate a separate home.img filesystem to conserve the exhaustible OS overlay (see
LiveOS image
), nor does it copy the livecd-iso-to-disk installation script to the new device to permit generation of a new Live USB device from the first.
Note if graphical liveusb-creator program will not make a bootable USB-stick from an .iso file:
(This can happen if the stick is formatted to fat16 on another PC with a different Operating System.)
Use terminal command :
liveusb-creator --reset-mbr
USB-stick must be formatted: fat16/32; Labeled=LIVE; boot flag set.
(The LIVE label is only required when the device is to be used for a subsequent uncompressed installation to a hard disk.)

Setup Mac to Autostart VirtualBox on startup
how to set it up
When making a new VM
, to clear the Sugar Journal of old entries and to avoid identity conflicts among copies of the VM, enter the command
rm ~ rf /.sugar
in the Terminal activity. Then shutdown the VM. This will clear all Learner information on the VM and let you start with a fresh install. Skipping this will result in collisions in the Neighborhood view of the Jabber network between separate copies of the appliance. Verify the presence of the
.sugar
directory by entering
ls -a
in Terminal.
When cloning a customized VM
, in order to keep the Journal and installed .xo Activities, use
rm ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
in the Sugar Terminal, and then
shutdown the VM
. enter in root terminal:
su (password) shutdown -h now
This leaves the Journal entries and removes only the previous Learner's identity key files.

Possible Use Cases
(from Wiki Page)
Curriculum packaging
1. A teacher wants to prepare a SoaS image with a custom set of installed Activity bundles or a Journal of Activity instances for an upcoming class term.
  2. The teacher modifies their current working image by adding or deleting Activity bundles from their Home view and adding or removing Journal entries with specific content
   (such as a Physics model template or Etoys project), even saving distributable ebooks, or bookmarks in Browse Activity instances that are named for specific sets of local web destinations
   (a class portal perhaps for deployments lacking Internet connectivity).
  3. The teacher scrubs out any personal passwords or other history that should not be shared in the new copies.
  4. A fresh or recycled USB stick is inserted into the computer running the customized SoaS image and the SugarClone script is executed.
Full image backup or sharing
1. A Learner has modified their environment, perhaps adding Activity bundles and prepared specific instances such as a Activities/Physics simulation.
  2. Their modifications include changes to their operating system installed through yum or RPM to obtain some new core functionality.
  3. The Learner wants to archive or share this image with friends or for a backup.
  4. Personal or private information is scrubbed from the Journal or Browse history and other potential stores.
  5. The User creates one or more Sugar Clones.
This method of backup has the advantage that it copies Learner changes to the core operating system as well as the Journal. A LiveOS image using a separate persistent home folder could be partially cloned with either the operating system overlay or home folder without the other should that be desired.

Open Terminal and type the following to install Boa (approx. 100k)
su -
yum -y install boa
Now put your index.html in /var/www
Find your Sugar Computer/XO's IP Address. Still as root user (having entered su- already), enter into Terminal:
ifconfig
Look next to eth0 for 192.168.whatever (for example)
Go to another machine on your LAN and type your Sugar Computer/XO's IP Address into your browser.  There's your Sugar computer serving up a web page!

Pungi
Advanced
used to build non-live CD/DVD isos
Pungi needs to run on the arch it is composing, as root, and with an install of what it is composing, eg if you are composing Fedora 8, you need to be running Fedora 8.
This is so that the correct userland tools are used to create the images and such used by anaconda.
The eventual usage of pungi will most likely be in mock chroots to facilitate this.
It needs to run on the arch it is composing due to how anaconda-runtime determines what files to put in the boot images at this time.
Currently the releases of pungi are designed to run on an updated Rawhide system. Development of pungi always tracks Rawhide.
