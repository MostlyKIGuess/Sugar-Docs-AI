Can someone verify this information?
Updated information to refer to Sugar Coating.
Sugar Coating
Where's the source for the sugarize.so library?
How is this method preferable to already existing and discussed 'sugar coating' methods? Simply automation or other benefits?

I believe it's due to the automation. Why isn't this process built into the Sugar Control Panel??

The 'sugarize' information should be updated. The information is out of date for 8.2 and refers to an out of date script.  By the way scripts were derived from Bernie's I believe.

The source for the sugarize.so library is located at:

=Sugar Coating= Permission Denied.
I was able to download the files described, but when i tried to run ./sug I got a "Permissions Denied" message. Not knowing much Linux, but able to follow directions, I entered chmod a+s  /bin/chmod. 
I entered ./sug and i still got Permissions denied.
It would be helpful if I could copy screen shots to these comments. In any case the final messages for the first two commands on the OLPC were:
2009-09-16 17:40:49 (39.9 KB/s) - 'libsugarize.so' saved [2792/2792]
and
2009-09-16 17:53:32 (43.8 KB/s) - 'sug' saved [3776/3776]
The response to ./sug was
bash: ./sug: Permission denied
For the chmod a+s /bin/chmod
There was no response except the repeat of the prompt
bash-3.2#
Attempting to enter ./sug again was the Permission denied as above.
It does not appear i can go any further.
Any ideas.
It works!
It says in the yellow box that the program won't work on newer versions of sugar but it does. Maybe we should remove this since it might discourage users from trying that idea. My sugar version is 0.96.2 Also I didn't need to restart sugar at the end of sugar coating it immediatly showed up in Home View. --
