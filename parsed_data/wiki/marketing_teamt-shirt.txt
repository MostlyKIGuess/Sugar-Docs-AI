Activity related designs
This is an experimental t-shirt design based on an Activity icon surrounded by its name translated in currently available languages (as found in the source at the time of making). Versions could be made for each popular Activity. The "Black" version is probably most flexible as it can be printed in one colour, on a t-shirt of a different colour to provide a Sugar like fill/stroke effect. The PDF files are 100% vector artwork and can be printed to any scale.
