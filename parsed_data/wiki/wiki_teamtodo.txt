Ongoing Tasks
People are needed mostly for writing and editing, but there are many other ways of making a useful contribution. For example, simply pointing out errors (such as typos, grammar and spelling, and technical errors) is an extremely useful way to help.
Fix spelling and formatting errors
Simplify the structure of long pages
Organize untidy pages so that they are easy to read
Fix broken links
Add new documentation to the wiki
Add category tags where appropriate
Before you start contributing to the wiki, you should read the
Wiki Guide
for information on how to edit pages correctly. See the **Wiki Cleanup** page for tips on cleaning-up wiki pages.
Cleanup
The pages listed on
Category:Cleanup
are in need of a thorough cleanup.
These pages either:
Do not follow the standards of documentation,
Contain incorrect or out-of-date information, or
Are formatted incorrectly.
Feel free to dive in. Tidy up a page and remove the Cleanup **tag**!
If you find a page that needs to be cleaned up, DO NOT add it here. Follow the instructions as laid out on the Tag page.
Organize
Much of our work is getting the wiki organized.  We look through
Special:Allpages
to ensure that content is in the correct place
Coordinate
Coordination between wiki.laptop.org and wiki.sugarlabs.org.
Move content between w.s.o and w.l.o so that it lands in the most appropriate place.
Expand
Want to contribute your knowledge?
As an open source Wiki, we have a wide range of individuals working to help expand our resource, and we want your help.
Check out the list of articles with the Needs Expansion tag for articles that are formatted correctly, but simply need to be expanded to cover the full topic.
See the Community
TODO
list for more things that need doing.
