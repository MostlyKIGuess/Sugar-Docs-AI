Three possibilities
2.1
Direct Messaging
2.2
View Messaging / Bulletin Boards
2.3
Teacher/Server Override
Concept
Learners should be able to see other learners on the neighbourhood view and be able to send short messages to that person. These messages might come up as notifications when the recipient is in another application.
"Hi Andy, join the Write I have shared with you"
 "Okay Bella"
Three possibilities
Direct Messaging
Direct messaging would allow users to select each other and send a message. From there, a "Reply?" dialogue would allow the recipient to respond.
View Messaging / Bulletin Boards
The concept of a bulletin board for each view is expanded upon hereÂ :
Human_Interface_Guidelines/The_Laptop_Experience/Bulletin_Boards
Application view => Allows users to send messages those who are sharing that application
Home view => Allows learners to add sticky notes for themselves
Friends view => Allows learners to send notes to their friends
Neighbourhood view => Sends a global alert
Teacher/Server Override
This would enable teachers and parents to send messages to all learners that are connected. This would override any local settings, meaning that the messages would force themselves to be focused upon.
