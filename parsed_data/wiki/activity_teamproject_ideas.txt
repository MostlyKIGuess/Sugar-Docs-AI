Translate activity - consider sugarizing
http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/index
Also consider investigating cscott's Click2Trans.  Also consider a View Source like View Translations UI.

A
clock
for the frame.  (See
Design Team/Proposals/Frame#Frame Clock
.)
Some challenges:
suspend/resume friendly (maybe updates only on frame view and resume),
links to the settings (control) panel to update system/local time,
links to
Clock activity
for learning to tell time, to
Stopwatch
for timing events and setting alarms, and
Time
for learning more about time (which might eventually have a link to
Moon
).

Blogging activity for Sugar.
Blog aggregator for a mesh network.
Create Drupal/Wordpress sugar compatible themes and modules.
Sugarize PiTiVi, uses pygtk and gstreamer so seems like something quite doable.
Competitive/collaborative "trivia" activity -- there's a synchronized countdown, and then you get points for answering questions correctly and quickly.  Could use groupthink for scoring, maybe share data with assimilate/memorize?

what screen resolution should be minimal for activities?

I think 1024x768 is a good minimum.  is this too low?
thats enough for desktops, but netbooks may have something like 1024x600(Eee PC 900)
Ok, 1024x600 sounds good.  I contacted Eben Eliason to ask about his involvement.

Response from Eben: No need for a new HIG but he plans to look over the regular HIG to make sure it is relevant to activities.
Further suggestions:
User:satellit
Resume for browse on a shared activity from an icon: Start as private with drop down to make shared. The resume shared from the top icon may not be required or wanted.
Display of shared browse site name from icon on Neighborhood(F1)view raises privacy issues?
Infrastructure
Create activities@sugarlabs.org mailing list.
Questionable - I tend to think additional mailing lists just add additional barriers.
