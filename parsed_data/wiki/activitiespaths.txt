What is Paths?
Paths is a sliding tile game where the goal is to create closed paths. (
lang-es
)
How do you play?
64 tiles are to be arranged onto the 8×8 grid, positioning the tiles so that paths are created.
8 tiles at a time are place to the left of the grid in a staging area (on the left side of the screen). Move (by dragging) and rotate (by clicking) one tile at a time onto the grid. Connect the lines that run across the tiles to the lines on the other tiles on the grid to make paths. You cannot let a line run off edge of the grid, nor onto another tile without connecting to a line on that tile. An
X
will appear over connections that result in broken paths.
Note:
Once a tile is in position it cannot be moved.
The game is over when all tiles have been played or there is nowhere to place a tile without creating a broken path.
If you play against the computer, you must click somewhere
off of the grid
or on the ✓ button to indicate you've finished your turn.
Start by dragging a tile onto the grid.
Drag more tiles onto grid squares that are highlighted.
Paths must be connected across the tiles.
Keep going until the grid is filled. More tiles will appear on the left in groups of 8.
Broken paths: the lines do not connect on abutting tiles.
A completed grid
Whenever you close a path, it is highlighted in your 'XO' colors.
When playing with more than one player, you'll be prompted when it is your turn.
