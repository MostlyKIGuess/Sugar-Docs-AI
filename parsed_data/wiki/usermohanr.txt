I am a computer science masters student specializing in HCI (Human Computer Interaction) at University of British Columbia. I have been working in as a software engineer in various capacities for the past 6 years. Most of it has involved Python, a language that seems to fit my brain.
I am interested in designing interfaces that facilitate learnability, especially for children and artists. I have witnessed the frustration that young children and artists face (being an amateur artist myself) as a result of suboptimal workflows and designs when they use computers to express their creativity . I believe that serving as tools for creative expression and helping us unlock our creative potential is one of the important roles that computers could play in our society. I feel it is worthwhile to work with children and artists in making computers a viable part of their creativity tool-set.
