keys.sugarlabs.org is down and won't come back
keys.sugarlabs.org
was
an OpenPGP
key server
powered by the
SKS
keyserver software.
We use
Monkeysphere
to allow users to
authenticate our SSH host keys
using their PGP web of trust. Future plans include
managing user keys
(authorized_keys) as well. Monkeysphere regularly searches for and fetches (potential)
OpenPGP
keys for all users to check for new and/or revoked keys, which causes some load on keyservers. In order not to annoy operators of (other) public keyservers, we run our own. As a nice side effect we contribute back to the OpenPGP community by being
part of
the
SKS keyserver pool
, similar to what we do for
NTP
.
