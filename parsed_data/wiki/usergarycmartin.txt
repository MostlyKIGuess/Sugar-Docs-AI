Memorize toolbar mockups
Default main view
This is the default main view with an initial game played part way through. Ideally a resumed Memorize activity instance should remember the state of the game from when it was Stopped. Note that the old
Create --> New game
icon is being used to replace the
Restart
game icon. From this view new games can easily be played at different difficulties and with different demo game sets.
Play new game
Play new game
restarts the currently active set of question tiles.
Example using standard Edit toolbar for game customisation
The
Edit toolbar
. OK, here's the more controversial case... The standard
Edit
toolbar has the additional tools required for game customisation, it also redraws the main canvas with the game creation UI holding the currently active game questions (note the
Clear
tool button for quickly removing all questions). This means both clicking and delayed hovering over the
Edit
tool button redraws the canvas with the game creation UI. This may feel wrong and be less obvious how to escape from the view if triggered by a hover delay (as moving the cursor into the canvas area should not hide the game creation UI). If folks think this is overloading the default
Edit
metaphor from its usual basic copy & paste features, we could add a new primary icon for the game creation UI - perhaps it could be a primary button with only a help hint palette, no secondary palette, and have the game type controls on the game creation canvas? (this would avoid the full canvas delayed hover issue)
Example using cog icon for game customisation features
After some email/irc discussion it seems overloading the existing edit UI with new editing features has too many negatives, this example breaks out the customisation features into a cog icon (as used in the Abacus Activity and view source menu icon). Discussion about using the cog icon or some new visual is ongoing.
Activity toolbar with import/export features
The
Activity toolbar
includes the usual widget suspects along with the old Memorize
Load game
and
Save game
icons features. The load/save allow for custom quiz creation similar to the previous Memorize work flow (but they would not strictly be necessary if
Keep
didn't generate objects that share the same activity ID, or in the future if we replace
Keep
with a simple Journal duplicate object feature). These two features should be renamed to
Import game
and
Export game
. The Activity title is used as the exported name.
Example work flows
Simple play through of a demo game:
child starts a new instance of Memorize from the Home view spiral
plays the default demo game, and/or selects one from the demo game list, and/or adjusts the number of game grid tiles
teacher asks child to stop playing while she sets homework for the class, child clicks Stop
later that evening child resumes the Memorize activity from their Journal and continues playing from where they had previously stopped
Make a new Memorize activity based on some existing content:
child starts a new instance of Memorize from the Home view spiral
imports a game called
Capital Cities of the World
that one of their friends shared with them
clicks Edit and edits the game by adding ten new harder questions
changes the Activity Title to
Capital Cities of the World, extra hard
plays a few rounds of the game to try it out before collaborating and challenging their friends to a game
Modify an existing Memorize activity:
child resumes a Memorize activity from their Journal that a friend shared with them
clicks
Edit
toolbar button and edits the game by adding some new questions, and correcting some spelling mistakes
clicks
Play new game
, and plays a few rounds of the game to try it out before challenging their friends to a game
Make a new Memorize game from sctarch
child starts a new instance of Memorize from the Home view spiral
clicks the
Edit
tool button
clicks the
Clear
tool button in the
Edit
secondary toolbar
adds their game questions/answers using the
Edit
game creation canvas
clicks the
Play new game
toolbar icon and plays through their game to try it out
clicks the
Activity
toolbar icon and enters a title for their game
clicks
Stop
