Let's Build it Together: Sugar Labs' First Fundraiser
2024 Spring
Purpose
One goal of the fundraiser is to create a solid foundation for Sugar Labs. Additional goals are working toward starting and hosting an annual "Sugar Code-In" and helping us have the financial means to further our own growth.
Goals
For this first fundraiser, we have multiple tiers of goals, which span from $50k-$225k. The more money we can raise, the more we can do with that money towards
our mission
.
For transparency, we're putting our goal numbers into the following budget items:
Funds for general operations for the next six months (presumably weâ€™ll do a year-end fundraiser):
$50k-75k
Funds to launch a "Sugar Code-In" (over the winter months '24-'25):
$20k-40k to (pay stipends for mentors and improve infrastructure to support this program)

$5k-10k

$25k-100k
