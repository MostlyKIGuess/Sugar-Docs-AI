File Share
File Share Activity
File Share Server
I worked as a part of
RIT's School Server
team.  While working on the school server I started to build a
File Distribution System
as a prototype.  This prototype was a simple php upload script. It allowed files to be uploaded and shared.  After working on the prototype I decided to build a
File Share Activity
that would allow files to be shared between the xo's over the mesh network.  Once the file share activity was successfully sharing files between xo's I started working on a new
File Share Server
prototype because I found that my file distro server was too buggy to simply integrate with the xo activity.  This server is a simple python script that allows file uploads.
Fortune Hunter
I am a member of the
Fortune Hunter
team at RIT.
Currently the lead developer of the new game engine and in the process of porting the prototype game code to this new engine
Developed and coded the
Fortune Maker
activity that provides a simple gui to build dungeons for Fortune Hunter.
