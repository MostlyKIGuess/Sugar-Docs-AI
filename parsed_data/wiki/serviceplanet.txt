Notes
The planet configuration data is stored in a git repository with automatic checkouts on pulls. See
Sysadmin/Autocheckout repositories
for more details.
To edit planet data:
git clone planet.sugarlabs.org:/srv/www-sugarlabs/planet
...edit...
git commit -m "what i changed" <file1> <file2>...
To test a configuration change without waiting for the cronjob:
cd /srv/www-sugarlabs/planet
# write your changes to config2.ini
sudo -u planet planet config2.ini
Upgrade notes
We're using the Ubuntu package of Planet Venus, which is very old. Switching to git would be easy, but the advantage isn't clear.
