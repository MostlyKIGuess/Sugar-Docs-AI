Our goal is to allow any XO user or XO in book mode (even as a kiosk) to select and create:
USB sticks (such as
Sugar on a Stick
) An instruction document
Creation Kit
is helpful
a CD or DVD disc from an .iso image if an external drive is connected
We will use as simple a user interface as possible for use semi-unattended as a kiosk.  We plan to do extensive compatibility testing on XO 1.0 and 1.5 hardware as well as on builds which are already deployed.  An important part of making this activity successful will be implementing methods that are usable on as wide a hardware and software user base as possible.
Our project
was approved
for the
OLPC Contributor program
after completing a
proposal
.  Our development environments also include Virtualbox hosted .iso images.
We are making progress.
There are many ways to create USB sticks and much work has been done that we can use.  Creating a CD or DVD is relatively simple with connected hardware.  Collaboration is encouraged as we get the project going.  We recommend you begin by providing input through the
email list
. Inspiration for this project comes from many similar projects to share free and open source software.

are developing similar features but not that I have seen at the activity level.
possible naming confusion (we are Toaster) with Trisquel on a Sugar Toast
