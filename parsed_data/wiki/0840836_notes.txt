Sucrose 0.83.6 Release Notes
Announcement
This is Release Candidate 2 for the upcoming 0.84 Release - see the
Development Team/Release/Roadmap#Schedule
for more details. Only one more week to go in this release cycle. Please test this release and report all the bugs you find that we are able to fix them in time. A friendly
BugSquad
will be available to triage those bugs accordingly and the developers can never have enough bug food. If you have non-bug feedback about features you can use the sugar-devel mailing list to share it with us.
From a user point of view we want to highlight the following changes that have been made:
Resume by Default
Resume by default is now the way we handle activity startup. The option in the Favourites View palette has been removed completely. You can still start a new instance using the 'Start' option in the Activity palette.
View Source
There has been some refinements to the View Source dialog. You can access it from the Activity palette in the Frame or by using 'Shift+Alt+V' directly.
The coloured activity icon represents the source of the activity instance. The outlined activity icon represent the bundle source for the activity itself, the template. We use this to help draw a distinction between the "activity instance" and the "activity bundle"
Using the uncoloured outline to represent the bundle vs the coloured icon to represent an instance has been the design cue all along.
File transfer
Updated the file transfer code to make use of the new icons that Eben draw for us.

Morgan fixed an error that was introduced due to changes in Evince.
Browse
Martin Langhoff has been adding functionality to authenticate with the Schoolserver. When registered with the server an HTTP Cookie is created to ease the use of services on the Schoolserver in future sessions. Thanks to Daniel Drake Browse propagates the current locale now. This helps to use web services and pages in your mother language. Try it out with the
addons
page for example.
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
When you upgrade a computer running an earlier version,
The old datastore will be updated to the new format.
Your old profile (in
.sugar/default/config
) will be imported into GConf
If you later downgrade from Sucrose 0.83.x to an earlier version,
The datastore is incompatible
You will be prompted to enter all your profile settings like you are on first boot
Most of the activities in Sucrose 0.83.x should be compatible with Sucrose 0.82 , the version shipped with
XO Software Release 8.2.0
.  An exception is Browse, which depends on new versions of XULRunner and Hulahop.  Read likewise may soon depend on a new version of Evince
