When Sugar Labs was very large, we found it convenient and effective to divide into teams. This page listed the teams.
Teams at Sugar Labs provided general services in their subject areas across the spectrum of projects. Team members were active in multiple areas. See
Category:Team
.
Educational
Sugar is useful only to the extent it is used by the learning community.
Education Team
The mission of the education team is to explain
why
Sugar is an ideal platform for learning, and to provide guidance and feedback to those who are working on
how
Sugar enhances learning.
Walter Bender
Deployment Team
The mission of the Deployment Team is to voice the needs of Sugar deployments to the Sugar community, to find ways to support those needs, to organize forums for the exchange of experiences between Sugar users and Sugar developers, and to build local Sugar Labs organizations worldwide.
Pilar Saenz
Walter Bender
Technical
Learners should “share by default” and be able to “explore, express, debug, and critique.”
Development Team
The mission of the Development Team is to build and maintain the core Sugar environment.  This includes specifying and implementing new features in conjunction with the
Design Team
, fixing bugs as they are found by the Testing team and the Sugar community, and generally making Sugar awesome in all ways.
None
The Development Team always needs help with fixing bugs and writing cool new activities.
Design Team
The mission of the Design Team was to make Sugar beautiful, elegant, and highly functional for our target users.
Gary C Martin
Manuel Quiñones
The Design Team needed help reviewing the roadmap for Sugar 9.1.
Activity Team
The Activity Team develops and maintains many of the activities available for Sugar.  We also encourage independent developers to write activities, and we support them in their efforts. Our goal is to ensure that Sugar provides a complete set of high quality educational, collaborative, constructivist activities.
Our responsibilities
Develop and maintain the ecosystem of Sugar activities.
Recruit and mentor activity developers from the community.
Collect, document and organize new activity and activity feature ideas from the
Education Team
, deployments and community.
Work with the
Development Team
and the
Infrastructure Team
to ensure activity developers are well supported.
Gather feedback with the
Deployment Team
about how Sugar activities are doing in the field.
Gonzalo Odiard
Gary C Martin
The Activity Team was always looking for new members.
BugSquad
The mission of the BugSquad is to be responsive to incoming bug reports. The Squad needs to triage the bugs and work towards a solution with the reporters and the developers until the issue is solved. Therefore it has an important role in making the end product better and can be seen as the liaison between testers/users and developers.
Simon Schampijer
Documentation Team
The mission of the Documentation team is to provide the Sugar community with high quality documentation, including learners' manuals, programming references, and tutorials.
open position
Wiki Team
The mission of the Wiki team is to maintain the Sugar Labs wiki, and to help the Sugar Labs teams and the greater educational community to collaborate effectively.
Frederick Grose
The Wiki team needed talented wiki gardeners to take loving care of overgrown wiki pages.
Translation Team
Enable users and developers to use Sugar and Sugar Labs services regardless of their native tongue.
The following users perform administrative functions on the Pootle server.  These are related to setting up languages for the first time, adding software projects to languages, and so forth.  The best way to reach them is to post a request on the
localization list
.

Bernie Innocenti
The Infrastructure team can always use smart sysadmins.
Community
Sugar Labs is here to support community innovation, entrepreneurship, and enterprise.
Marketing Team
The mission of the Marketing team is to articulate the benefits of Sugar (simplify), to promote these benefits as widely as possible (amplify), and to recruit volunteers to improve the Sugar experience.
Davelab6
The Marketing team needed wordsmiths to refine the Sugar message, mavens to spread that message, and translators to broaden that message.
Oversight Board
The mission of the oversight board is to ensure that the Sugar Labs community has clarity of purpose and the means to collaborate in achieving its goals. (See
