Anne Gentle is a senior technical writer volunteering for the
Documentation Team
. I have two kids and love introducing technology to them. I currently work a flexible 30-hour work week to spend more time with my family and home, but I like to stay busy. I have a lot of energy because these busy but balanced days fill me up rather than tire me out.
