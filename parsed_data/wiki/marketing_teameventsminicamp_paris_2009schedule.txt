La Ruche ("The Beehive") describes itself as a "living laboratory".
It's an alternative space which provides office infrastructure and
support in a relaxed environment for ethical entrepreneurs ("social
business").
Their meeting room has a capacity of 30 people and is equipped with
wifi, videoprojector, and whiteboard. Outside the meeting room is a
lounge area conducive for informal discussions.
They are located along the charming Canal Saint Martin
a short walk from Place de la République. Film buffs will recognize
the Hôtel du Nord. Many restaurants and cafés are in the vicinity.
