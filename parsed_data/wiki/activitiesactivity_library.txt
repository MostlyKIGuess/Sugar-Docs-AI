Support 0install by design
use .xo format only if requested by user
otherwise, activities should just start by click
activities will be represented by regular 0install feeds
more flexible dependency checking than on ASLO (currently, only SP version), if activity requires a recent gst to run, it just declares that gst version
a variety of activity versions will be checked at runtime to detect what versions could be run on that particular machine before launching
with 0launch (or with a special variant) it will be possible to run Library activities out of the
Activity Library
activity
Support forks
bundle_id should not be owned by any one developer. For the same bundle_id, there could be dozens of activities (and not only direct forks)
No strict editors policy
by default (or at least, there should be such an option), any user can launch any activity w/o additional steps (such as being logged in to ASLO)
there could be review profiles. A user could apply such a profile to disperse all activities to reviewing groups, e.g., Featured, Major, Trash etc.
such profiles could be also created for particular deployment and tested by QA teams
Support 0install stability profiles, e.g., Stable, Development, Buggy
Support local user profile, e.g.,
use only Stable versions
make my-favorite-developer's activities always show while using list
One button click update, i.e., synchronize current activities with server's (taking into account
Provide centralized stats that are easy-to-use by activity developers (option in activity.info), and easy-to-view by Activity Library users.
counting successful/failed launches by SP level, could be useful to judge activity stability
tracking average duration of use or number of launches, etc.
