About Me
Hi My name is Ariel Zamparini, I am currently a student at Rochester's Institute of Technology. I have been a student here for just about 2 and a half years now. I am studying Game Design and Development as part of RIT's own interactive games and media department.
I have a very high interest for anything dealing with technology and am always willing to experience more of the world what ever it may be. My hobbies include various things from computers, cars and video games.
I am very good at programming but relatively bad at anything with art/design.
And as always Thanks for visiting -Ariel.
