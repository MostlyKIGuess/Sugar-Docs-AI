Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Sugar doc status
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Sugar_doc_status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Many Sugar activities are documented in the wiki (See
Activities
for a list of activity homepages in the wiki). At a recent documentation sprint, we came up with a common framework for activity documentation. See
Activities/Portfolio
,
Activities/Abacus
,
Activities/Dimensions
, et al. as examples.
Task
Identify which Sugar Activities are lacking home pages in the wiki and which ones need updating to the new format.
