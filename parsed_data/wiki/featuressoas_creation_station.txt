This CD provides a complete set of tools for Creating a Custom Remix of Soas.
Requires installation to a Hard Disk
to allow Building .iso's.
Recommended Install Method:
Sugar_on_a_Stick/ZyX-LiveInstaller
Works wih zyx.?
(still testing=looks like livecd-tools may use too many resources with the zyx-liveinstaller file structure)  still testing 09/09/2010 tg
Managed to do build on 16Gb USB took
4+ hrs
.
NOT PRACTICAL (as need LVM structured install for enough room)
08/14/2010
zyx-liveinstaller copies the SCS CD exactly (as It is running on Users Desktop.) Any personal customization is transferred to a normal file system on the users Hard Disk
zyx-liveinstaller (In fedora repositories) is included on the SCS.iso
CD also includes gparted; livecd-tools, spin-kickstarts.
liveinst(Anaconda) does not transfer the custom features of the SCS.iso
Coordination with the Remixability feature.
Features/SoaS Remixability
May require using Anaconda with custom anaconda.cfg and .ks (If this is possible)

Shared kickstart files e-mailed to SOAS and posted to wiki allow others to learn how to make a .ks file and try various remixes.
Posted links to a Catalog of prebuilt remix.iso's, with a description of their use and contents, allows less skilled users to use them.
