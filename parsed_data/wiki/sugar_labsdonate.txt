Our Mission
Sugar LabsÂ® is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a global mission to create educational opportunities in technology to youth around the world. Volunteer mentors and contributors work together to develop activity-focused software for children. All software is developed with learning as the primary goal, necessitating the need for source code to be published publicly for study, licensed under a Free/Libre license for explicit permission to share and remix -- worked upon openly within a community where students are invited to make contributions -- under guidance of experienced mentors. Donations to support the work of Sugar Labs can be made at
