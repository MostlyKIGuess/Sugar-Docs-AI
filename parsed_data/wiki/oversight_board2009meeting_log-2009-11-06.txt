<SeanDaly>
walterbender: don't forget I am only there 3 nights so upgrade to double room might not work either
<walterbender>
Welcome everyone
SeanDaly	is here :-)
<walterbender>
I'd like to start by asking if there were any additional topics people want to add the agenda.
SeanDaly	no
<walterbender>
The three topics outstanding are: mailing lists, positions, and dp
<walterbender>
let's get started on the first topic.
<walterbender>
#topic the SLOBs mailing list
<walterbender>
I had sent a note to IAEP regarding the ad hoc nature of the membership of the list
<walterbender>
I think that the more people on the list, the more likely we will use it instead of the public lists, which is in my mind, a bad habit.
<walterbender>
IMHO (not so humble, perhaps) we should be using it rarely, only for the most confidential matters, which suggests a very tightly controlled list.
<SeanDaly>
at the same time, I believe there is a need for a confidential list when discussing potential partners
<walterbender>
so I would propose it be ONLY board members, out ombudsman, and a representaive of SFC.
_bernie	waves
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: I agree. and we can invite people into discussions on an as needed basis.
-->|	jsgotangco (n=JSG@ubuntu/member/jsgotangco) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walterbender>
but right now, I couldn't even tell yo who is on the list, so I am uncomfortable sending confidential materials, so I by-pass the list with private emails, etc. a terrible habit
<SeanDaly>
or, as sometimes happens, there is an issue with a particular journalists, and as a rule I never refer to journalists by name on public lists... recipe for disastrous coverage
<walterbender>
I am simple-minded. I would like really needs to be private and everything else as my two options.
<walterbender>
the gray zone is a problem for me.
|<--	jsgotangco has left freenode (Client Quit)
	-->|	CanoeBerry (i=CanoeBer@dhcp-49-129.media.mit.edu) has joined #sugar-meeting
<m_stone>
walterbender: have you considered variations on a mailing list which are still email-friendly but which might offer more flexibility?
<walterbender>
m_stone: can you please elaborate?
<CanoeBerry>
Hiya, sorry I'm late.
<walterbender>
m_stone: bernie has a schema where by the list can be wite-only to the community...
<walterbender>
hi adam
<m_stone>
sure. some issue trackers like RT and Roundup have good email support.
<CanoeBerry>
If anybody has a pastebin of the past 10 min?
<m_stone>
so some people use them like funny mailing lists -- they collect email from anyone who wants to send it.
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry:
http://pastebin.be/21779
SeanDaly	waves to CanoeBerry
<m_stone>
however, subsequent distribution is controlled on a per-thread basis
<walterbender>
m_stone: I think collecting the input from anyone is important
<_bernie>
CanoeBerry:
http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting.log.20091106_1001.html
<m_stone>
walterbender: sure. you can configure it so that anyone can send.
<walterbender>
m_stone: yes. Bernie confirmed this
<m_stone>
walterbender: you then provide several mail aliases for each group of people you want to distinguish as recipients.
<_bernie>
walterbender: I can change it now
<walterbender>
_bernie: let's wait until we get the whole matter decided.
<m_stone>
walterbender: and you can add and remove them from per-ticket CC lists as needed.
<walterbender>
m_stone: I still think having a list that is known to be small and private is the heart of the issue.
<m_stone>
walterbender: known to be private over what period of time?
|<--	FranXOphonie has left freenode (Read error: 145 (Connection timed out))
<m_stone>
and known to be private indefinitely for every thread, or just known to be private /by default/, until a thread is declassified and made public?
<walterbender>
m_stone: private always.
-->|	bertf (n=bertf@p57AD24C1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #sugar-meeting
<CanoeBerry>
Who has long-term access to the archives? All futures board members and all future ombuds?
<CanoeBerry>
The independence of an ombuds is his/her strength, so we may want to think a bit.
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: I think that would have to be the case.
<walterbender>
In any case, we seem to be talking about implementation details, not the basic quesiton.
-->|	lucian (n=lucian@77-98-240-65.cable.ubr09.newc.blueyonder.co.uk) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walterbender>
Is there any one opposed to the idea of a limited list?
<cjb>
walterbender: I'm not sure yet
<CanoeBerry>
bertf: any recommendations?
<walterbender>
cjb: please voice your concerns
<cjb>
I think it would be fine if just about every mail currently going to slobs@ moves to iaep@, but I'm having trouble working out whether that would actually happen.. I'll try to read over the archives and think some more
<mchua>
Hey all, sorry I'm late - plane *just* touched down (I'm still sitting in it). /me reads backlog
<walterbender>
cjb: consider also the email not sent to slobs, but as private threads
<cjb>
in particular, we talk about things like grants quite a lot on slobs
<bertf>
CanoeBerry: I'm fine either way. I personally don't need archive access.
<cjb>
walterbender: but I can only think of one or maybe two private threads this year
<cjb>
walterbender: so I wouldn't optimize for those.
<SeanDaly>
cjb: some mails I don't send to slobs, so confidential I send privately
<m_stone>
cjb: only one or two private threads or only one or two private threads that you've been included on? :)
<cjb>
SeanDaly: to me? I don't think I've received any from you.
<cjb>
SeanDaly: so it seems like this change wouldn't affect that.
<walterbender>
cjb: in fact, one problem with the private emails is that don't tend to reach all of the board.
<SeanDaly>
cjb: no not you yet... but in fact i would rather you did
<walterbender>
I send private email when I would rather send a message to the entire board
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: +1
<cjb>
so the argument is "I send private e-mail to a random subset of the board, and would like to send it to all the board instead, by typing in their e-mail addresses is too hard"? It just all seems a bit confused.
<walterbender>
but I don't always remember to do the 7 ccs and I always forget to include Bert
<walterbender>
and Karen
<cjb>
s/by typing/but typing/
<bertf>
fwiw I don't think the ombuds needs to be "kept in the loop" all that much, rather act when necessary
<CanoeBerry>
walter's point that emails will end up in private threads without the (added) transparency of archiving is very relevant.
mchua	all caught up now
<CanoeBerry>
bertf: thanks
<walterbender>
In any case, the SLOBs list as it stands is essentially useless.
<mchua>
I think there is a need for a list that is SLOBs and only SLOBs (to which I'd be fine adding ombuds and one SFC rep). I think other use cases we're discussing here may have their place, but independent of those and what they are and such, I think there /is/ a need for a list that is just SLOBs.
<SeanDaly>
cjb: well... not random... just the people I know well & trust. I'm saying I'd rather reach all the slobs on such issues
<cjb>
anyway, what I was going to say: we currently use slobs for things like talking about grants and stuff
<cjb>
and people who we've admitted to the list get to read that, offer their help with drafts and proofreading and so on
<cjb>
and that seems useful to me. we don't have to trust them, but we are doing so, and that seems helpful. the people reading know that the material is confidential.
<tomeu>
sorry, I'm late
<SeanDaly>
cjb: observer status... was my case starting from some point although I felt uncomfortable responding, as a nonSLOB at the time
<cjb>
so that's my reservation. it seems like we want to cut down on something that's seemed useful to me, and the justification is to help reduce private threads, but I haven't seen any private threads other than one that I can recall, but apparently there are more going on without me, and I'm to believe that I'd be included in them if only there were an easy alias.
<CanoeBerry>
i'm _not_ proposing this as an answer, but am intrigued by ideas like m_stone's old suggestion to make slobs' subject lines (more) public
<_bernie>
cjb: at this time we can freely discuss our relationship with Canonical on SLOBs just because nobody from Canonical is subscribed.
<m_stone>
CanoeBerry: that was somebody else's suggestion.
<_bernie>
cjb: would you agree that we'd have to use private cc's if Canonical were reading our board list?
-->|	sdziallas (n=sebastia@fedora/sdziallas) has joined #sugar-meeting
SeanDaly	waves to sdziallas
<cjb>
_bernie: well, I think at the moment someone from Canonical asked to join our board list, we'd say "Hm, better not, we might want to talk about you."
sdziallas	waves to SeanDaly an all
<sdziallas>
s/an/and ...sorry, I'm late.
<m_stone>
I think that mchua is basically right that having an email address which gets things sent to The SLOBS and no one else is useful...
<SeanDaly>
cjb: I guess you mean "you" as "Canonical" and not the person ;-)
<cjb>
SeanDaly: :)
<cjb>
indeed
<m_stone>
and still orthogonal from controlling the actual audience of these threads /and/ from controlling their archiving status.
<cjb>
although both are possible!
<mchua>
cjb: but we have folks from Red Hat and OLPC on SLOBs; what if we'd want to discuss the relationship with them?
<_bernie>
cjb: then why do we admit people from OLPC, Red Hat, Solution Grove... even L'Oreal? :-)
<cjb>
mchua: then a private thread would be fine. note that *I'm* on SLOBs, which means that mailing list would not be appropriate either!
<walterbender>
Personally, I am comfortable talking to board members, regardless for whom they work
<SeanDaly>
mchua: wouldn't that board member have a role as relay to their org?
<cjb>
you'd have to use a private receipient list in either case
<walterbender>
they have a responsibility as a board member to SL, not their employer.
<_bernie>
walterbender: me too
<walterbender>
if they feel conflicted, they can opt out
<mchua>
walterbender: +1
<cjb>
that's fine too.
<walterbender>
when a board member act otherwise, they are viloating a trust
<CanoeBerry>
great discussion..just a time check en route: meeting is half over/half begun :)
<cjb>
anyway, I hope that was all some food for thought.
<cjb>
I think if the situation was like m_stone suggests, where we had some way of compensating for the decreased visibility of slobs work
<walterbender>
cjb: so would you like to defer action on this topic for a week?
<cjb>
then I'd be happy about this proposal
<cjb>
walterbender: that would be great
<SeanDaly>
here's a concrete example: we have been contacted by an EU institution willing to promote Sugar
<cjb>
I'll try and be more coherent about itby next week
<walterbender>
cjb: so can I nominate you to make a proposal for next week?
<SeanDaly>
Having lived in Brussels I know that as soon as word gets out, the high-pais lobbyists get into action
<cjb>
walterbender: yes, that sounds fair
<mchua>
So no voting on Walter's original proposal until it also includes "and what we're going to do to compensate for that list being membership limited is..." proposals?
<cjb>
SeanDaly: I think we could use some clarity on if/when slobs@ gets to hear about that
<walterbender>
#action cjb will propose a SLOBs list configuration at the next meeting
<SeanDaly>
I'd like the board to be on board with our approach
<CanoeBerry>
I think the idea of "alums" is important here too, as filthy as it sounds. EG. many people like David Farning are central, and they now partake (loosely) in the slobs@ mailing list. Some of that role will remain, no matter what we decide.
<SeanDaly>
no meeting set yet, but
<SeanDaly>
after meeting there will be topics to discuss...
mchua	suggests the usual "get community brainstorm going" approach for SLOBs list configurations
<walterbender>
So, I think we should move on to the next topic
<cjb>
mchua: that would be useful
<mchua>
cjb: use the page tomeu and I made as a template if it helps
<walterbender>
we have an action plan re mailing lists
mchua	ready to move on
<walterbender>
#topic SL appointments
mchua	thinks we need to have these discussions on-list rather than in-meeting, honestly, so we can spend our time in meetings Voting Very Quickly
<SeanDaly>
mchua: which list? (joke) :D
<CanoeBerry>
mchua: "Listening" to people live helps me personally.
<walterbender>
Summary: we have a number of appointed positions and no policy re how to continue the appointments
<mchua>
Any proposals on such that we can vote on?
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: fixed terms, and vote by board to renew term or not?
<mchua>
If not, suggest we assign point person(s) like we just did for lists and regroup when there are proposals to select from
<CanoeBerry>
Not that term limits are required (I don't know) but we should have an annual review or such.
<tomeu>
should we ask other orgs about their experience?
<SeanDaly>
not a bad idea to formalize it... the usual scenario is someone longserving in post, and less effective, or less motivated; bring new blood in etc.
<CanoeBerry>
Yes
<SeanDaly>
"canonical" example: FDR in office 34 years, led to 2-term limit
-->|	erickTutorius (n=erick@132.210.76.198) has joined #sugar-meeting
<walterbender>
34 years?
<walterbender>
in a parallel universe, perhaps :)
<CanoeBerry>
I haven't heard much from Farning in the last 2 weeks about the treasurer role.. does he wish to continue?
<CanoeBerry>
Was someone supposed to talk this over with him?
<SeanDaly>
I must be mixed up with 1934... he did 3 terms and change
<walterbender>
I was late in getting in touch with him
<walterbender>
I can sort things out in Bolzano with him.
<CanoeBerry>
Great.
<walterbender>
No one was tasked with talking to me re ED :)
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: I didn't see his dates on the Bolzano page, hope he will be there
<CanoeBerry>
And
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board
specifies "sysadmin" is a 4th role.
<walterbender>
He is there all week, I believe
<cjb>
CanoeBerry: that doesn't seem necessary anymore
<walterbender>
SeanDaly: BTW, I am staying at the hostel
<SeanDaly>
walterbender: ok, if they don't have tomato juice there pop over to the hotel bar :D
<CanoeBerry>
hostel has no wifi FYI
<tomeu>
SeanDaly: yes, he's coming
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: :(
<walterbender>
so regarding actions on this topic...
<CanoeBerry>
They won't even allow us to plug into the wall.
<walterbender>
we have 2 issues: the policy and filling the roles
<walterbender>
can we focus on the policy first
<tomeu>
CanoeBerry: maybe you can catch up some sleep while there ;)
<SeanDaly>
canoeberry: my hotel has free wifi & if my 3G card roams at a decent rate I can loan
<walterbender>
personally, I think an annual review is a necessary requirement
<CanoeBerry>
SeadDaly: Don't get your card canceled!
<CanoeBerry>
Putting some meat on the annual review would be great.
<SeanDaly>
canoeberry: no risk
<CanoeBerry>
I think m_stone & hhardy have helped me & Bert a lot here in the ombuds case.
<mchua>
time running out... what are we trying to accomplish at this meeting? lots of forward momentum here, but no resolutions yet.
<CanoeBerry>
15min to go
<tomeu>
what is an annual review?
<CanoeBerry>
Are elections annual, speaking of which?
<walterbender>
tomeu: feedback
<tomeu>
and who does the review?
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: these are not elected positions: they are appointed by the board
<walterbender>
tomeu: the board
_bernie	notes that the sysadmin role is starting to become a full-time job. we need more volunteers on the Infrastruture Team.
<walterbender>
so I would propose an annyal review and as part of that review a discussion about mutual agreement to continue
<CanoeBerry>
Understood, but what if the appointed positions where required to report within 1-month of the completion each "annual" election?
<m_stone>
_bernie: or to be more careful about what demands are placed upon them.
<_bernie>
finding people who are at the same time skilled, trustworthy and free is a challenge.
<tomeu>
_bernie: how is icarito going?
<_bernie>
m_stone: I've been turning down any request that would make our infrastructure much more complex.
<_bernie>
m_stone: outsourcing git, trac and business apps to hosted services is my attempt to reduce the burden and increase service reliability.
<CanoeBerry>
Let's also formalize: how to remove appointed persons (without hurting feelings)
<walterbender>
so a concrete proposal would be: appoints are reviewed annually by the board; continuation subject to mutual consent.
<_bernie>
tomeu: he seems both skilled and trustworthy, but does not seem to have much time. I'll bug him a little more.
<tomeu>
ok
<_bernie>
tomeu: as I said, we need people with all 3 of these requisites AT THE SAME TIME :-(
<tomeu>
heh
<mchua>
Folks, this is great, but maybe we should discuss Infra stuff at an Infra meeting.
<_bernie>
mchua: there's no infrastructure meeting at this time, because it would go mostly deserted :-)
<_bernie>
anyway, let's go on with the next point. sorry to interrupt.
<CanoeBerry>
_bernie: can we talk by phone within 48hrs, since you refuse to come to Italy!?
<CanoeBerry>
Back to the agenda..
<mchua>
Are there any proposals we can vote on during this meeting, since our time is running short?
<_bernie>
CanoeBerry: haha ok :)
<walterbender>
mchua: any thoughts on my proposal
<mchua>
If not, perhaps we need to make sure we articulate a goal for our next meeting and make sure things happen between now and then so that we can decide then.
<mchua>
walterbender: I like it, is it a motion? ;)
<CanoeBerry>
Any thoughts on my defining "annually" as within about 1 month of each election?
<walterbender>
mchua: I am happy to make it a motion...
mchua	adds date, and puts forth MOTION: appointed positions reviewed annually by the board within a month of the new board's appointment, continuation subject to SLOBs approval vote and position-holder consent
<CanoeBerry>
*within about 1 month of the completion of each election
<walterbender>
motion: so a concrete proposal would be: appoints are reviewed annually by the board; continuation subject to mutual consent. (where annually means within 1 month of the board elections)
<mchua>
seconded
<walterbender>
discussion?
<SeanDaly>
fixed date?
<mchua>
"mutual consent" == SLOBs vote, and the position holder's acceptance
<CanoeBerry>
I think a removal/impeachment process is important.
<CanoeBerry>
So feelings are not hurt, when someone's life inevitably moves on.
<cjb>
CanoeBerry: maybe that can be a different motion :)
<CanoeBerry>
OK
<mchua>
how about "appointed positions can be appointed/removed by SLOBs vote"
<mchua>
that takes care of both motions
<SeanDaly>
mchua: the idea is to have at least some barrier to quickly removing e.g. ombudsman
<walterbender>
sounds good. mchua: wanna restate the motion?
<CanoeBerry>
But not too quickly.
<cjb>
SeanDaly: the barrier's a SLOBs vote
<CanoeBerry>
Ombuds should not be removable with 4 votes.
<CanoeBerry>
Ombuds needs independence, by definition.
<walterbender>
CanoeBerry: I agree
<cjb>
CanoeBerry: unanimous vote for ombuds, then?
<walterbender>
+1
<CanoeBerry>
Or perhaps a hypermajority.
<SeanDaly>
CanoeBerry: exactly. Impeachment <> voting somebody out; level of justification higher
<mchua>
someone restate motion?
<cjb>
MOTION: for the special case of removing the ombudsman, a unanimous SLOBs vote is required
-->|	tuukkah (i=tuukka@tuukka.iki.fi) has joined #sugar-meeting
<mchua>
MOTION:appointed positions can be appointed/removed by
<mchua>
SLOBs vote
<mchua>
argh
<cjb>
shall we vote through them now?
<CanoeBerry>
Can treasurer and ED be removed by 4 votes?
<cjb>
CanoeBerry: treasurer can
<cjb>
ED's a little unclear
<walterbender>
speaking as ED, I am willing to be subject to a majority removal from office.
<CanoeBerry>
OK, we have consensus, let's vote.
<cjb>
that settles that, then :)
<CanoeBerry>
+1
<CanoeBerry>
On both motions.
<walterbender>
all in favor of the motion(s) which I will write up in the minutes:
<cjb>
likewise, +1 on both
<SeanDaly>
can someone restate motion??
<cjb>
motion 1: appointed positions can be appointed/removed by
<cjb>
SLOBs vote
<cjb>
motion 2: for the special case of removing the ombudsman, a unanimous SLOBs vote is required
<walterbender>
motion 3: positions are reviewed annually
<SeanDaly>
yea to both then
<SeanDaly>
yea to all three
<walterbender>
within 1 month of elections
<CanoeBerry>
(with annual reviews required for all appointed positions, subject to majority vote in each case..)
<SeanDaly>
i would just add that should take place after SLOBS elections not before
<cjb>
oh, yes, we already scheduled that motion
walterbender	votes yes to all three
<CanoeBerry>
+1 on all 3
cjb	too.
<cjb>
mchua and _bernie?
mchua	yea on all 3
<tomeu>
+1 on all 3
<walterbender>
bernie?
<cjb>
bernie's going to get a reputation for doing all his voting in e-mail :)
<walterbender>
while we are waiting on Bernie (the motion has passed in any case :) let me wrap up:
-->|	BryanWB (n=BryanWB@c-68-48-36-68.hsd1.md.comcast.net) has joined #sugar-meeting
<CanoeBerry>
Anything else?
<CanoeBerry>
Time's up..
<walterbender>
we haven't heard back from the DP, so that discussion needs to be deferred :(
<CanoeBerry>
OK
<mchua>
Next meeting's goal: decision on mailing list?
<mchua>
cjb to drive?
<walterbender>
let's plan to meet again next week, some time, same channel?
<SeanDaly>
at Bolzano?
<--|	BryanWB has left #sugar-meeting ("Ex-Chat")
mchua	thinks we're doing pretty well at taking one topic at a time
<walterbender>
(I think it will work re the Bolzano agenda for most of us)
<CanoeBerry>
Next week I may be a bad citizen, but will try my best.
mchua	in Singapore and may be also, but will try as well.
<mchua>
In any case you only need 4 for quorum anyway :)
<mchua>
and Bolzano should suffice
<mchua>
if the meeting is done in IRC despite everyone being physically together.
<walterbender>
thanks for all the feedback today.
<CanoeBerry>
I will be traveling back from Europe thru Germany at that time..
<walterbender>
mchua: absolutely--in IRC.
mchua	queries about next meeting's goal - is "the list thing" it?
<mchua>
forward motion, one concrete little step at a time. :)
<walterbender>
mchua: we'll have a proposal from CJB re the list thing
<walterbender>
and we'll have a DP report (I hope)
<walterbender>
and I think some other topics looming.
<walterbender>
so, I will end the meeting... thanks again everyone.
