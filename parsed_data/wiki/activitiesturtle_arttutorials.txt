Mokurai's Tutorials
Mokurai
has been working on how to teach Sugar
by guided discovery
, rather than by explicit direction, with only the
necessary minimum of hints
. At the same time, he has been working on Turtle Art examples to teach concepts of mathematics, programming, Computer Science, and physics, aiming where possible at presentations suitable for pre-literate pre-schoolers. Thus, no text, no formulas, no calculations. Those can come later in sequences on the same topics as children develop, including a transition from Turtle Art to Python, Logo, and Smalltalk, with options for other languages. However, it is necessary to provide texts, sometimes with formulas and calculations, for the teacher or parent helping the child. These will appear on Mokurai's
Replacing Textbooks blog
, available at
PlanetSugarlabs
, and will be incorporated into
Open Education Resources
on the Sugar Labs
Replacing Textbooks
server
.
