Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Collections
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Collections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
The
Sugar activity portal
has a "
collections
" section. Collections are a way for you to categorize, mix, match and mingle activities. Subscribe to collections created by other users or create your own. It was expected that teachers would make use of collections to organize Sugar activities around pedagogical goals, but there has been little use of collections.
Task
Write a guide to using themed collections around project and curricula goals. (See
Math4Team/Florida
as an example of a wiki-based collection)
