Sean's Apt is working out well.  No furniture results in a lot of floor space for sleeping bags.  This waiting for Bernie to arrive.  We need our social director:)
Tomeu and I have arrived and met at Sean's apt.  There is no wifi yet so we are working in a small Cafe about a half a block away. We are meeting Simon in about one hour.
We left a note on the door to Sean's apt.  Please call Tomeu's cell phone if you need more directions.
