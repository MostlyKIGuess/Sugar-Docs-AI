SugarCamp Bolzano 2009
Event Details
The
FreeSoftwareWeek
2009 will be held from the 7th to 13th November 2009 in Bolzano, Italy. As part of free software week the
TIS
will host a Sugarcamp. A
GNOME Hackfest
will happen during that week as well. The camp fits quite well in our release cycle (0.88 planning/hacking) and having the GNOME Hackfest next door will hopefully create nice synergies.  The FreeSoftwareWeek will end with the
SFScon2009
the annual Free Software conference in South Tyrol.
