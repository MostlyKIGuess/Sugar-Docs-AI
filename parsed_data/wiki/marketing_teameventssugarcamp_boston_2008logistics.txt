Adopt a speaker!
These are out-of-town speakers (and links to their proposals) who could present at Sugarcamp.
Please feel free to add anyone I've missed; I just compiled this quickly by scanning emails to
devel@
and
sugar@
with 'Proposal' in the title.  If you're one of the listed developers, please add your location and the approximate cost of airfare, if you can determine it -- or remove yourself if you've made a proposal but aren't actually interested in attending, or can donate your own travel costs.  I tried to roughly sort by number of proposals made (talks to be given).
