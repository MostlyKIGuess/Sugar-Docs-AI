Introduction
Smoke testing is the first quick round of simple tests run on a new software build to verify that it starts and does not catastrophically crash. It is a preliminary to further testing, and is also a fast way to verify the basic integrity of a new development environment, as well as a good tour of basic functionality. The instructions below are for smoke-testing core Sugar using Activities included in Glucose (though it does not test the Activities themselves). To learn how to create smoke tests for other software (such as Activities), see
Release Team/Creating a Smoke Test
.
How to smoke test
Install
the current
Sugar image under test
. All smoke test cases assume you begin with a clean install of Sugar in Home view with no Activities running.
Review
Sugar on a Stick/Getting Involved
for known problems with your build.
Execute the smoke test cases below. Test cases are listed in priority order, so if you have limited time, go through them sequentially.
If a smoke test fails,
file a bug in Trac
noting the failure with as much detail and reproduction steps as possible.
Summarize your results to help other testers at
Sugar on a Stick/Getting Involved
.  Please help structure the test results pages. (Needed: a way to report smoke test results for builds.)

For the 0.84 release, we are using Fedora-based
Sugar on a Stick
as our common test image.
Installation and setup

,
#Activity sessions can be resumed
)
Close the Write Activity.
Servers and collaboration
This test case is not complete.
This test will require 2 instances of Sugar, likely on 2 computers/virtual machines, with the ability to connect with each other via an AP, XS, or Jabber server.
This test will verify:
registering with a XS / connecting to an AP / connecting to a Jabber server
making and removing friends
seeing other Sugar users in Neighborhood view
seeing shared Activity sessions in Neighborhood view
sharing an Activity session
inviting another Sugar user to a private Activity session
accepting invitations to an Activity session
Installing, modifying, and uninstalling Activities
This test case is not complete.
This test will require internet connectivity.
This test will verify:
selecting a means of connectivity
installing a new Activity
upgrading an existing Activity
uninstalling an existing Activity
editing an existing Activity
