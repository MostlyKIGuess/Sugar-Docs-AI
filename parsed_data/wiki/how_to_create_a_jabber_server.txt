--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugar collaboration is built on top of
XMPP (Jabber)
, an open and extensible
instant messaging
protocol.  Collaboration can use either Link-local connections, or a server.
Collaboration via a server is more scalable, but requires special Sugar support in the server.
A server can be set up using the
XS school server
for school deployments.
