Figure out if we need to 'yum clean all' after every update, to prevent yum from acting up!
metadata_expire
repository parameter prevents frequent fetching metadata from the server. Since we fetch updates on daily basis, it should fine.

Clear and complete error messages (even for crashes)
This is the ABRT feature. flash the notification icon, see a simple error, link to log activity and send report (implicit).
(Don't use fedora ABRT for the moment)
Description/Justification:
It is difficult for folks from non-technical backgrounds to give useful feedback when problems arise with the software. Such an automated bug reporting tool could be very useful for decreasing the time spent between deploying the software and identifying the bugs. This feature should be integrated with the notification system (described above).

kill the name picker that pops up when quitting activities (EASY)
:
Nobody ever uses it, it's just annoying and confusing for new users who don't know how to dismiss it. Maybe one day someone will come out with a less intrusive UI for the same purpose, but for the time being we're much better off without anything. (Gary suggests implementing
Features/Write_to_journal_anytime
)

Figure out why so many control panels require restarting Sugar, and fix them not to (MEDIUM)
:
Because we use GConf for settings, we should be able to setup callbacks to be invoked on any change.
(check with Hemanshu?)

Review usability and Patch
kill the "Mute" function on the volume icon in the frame (EASY)
:
I can't think of a useful use-case for it, and children often manage to turn on muting by simply clicking on the speaker icon (which is a lame UI, btw). If we remove this feature, we have to unconditionally unmute on startup! (Gary agreed and asked to file a ticket)

DONE
Notification system (tch)
:
A notification system for the sugar platform has been a long standing TODO. It would be very useful in the field for teacher-trainers and onsite developers to quickly triage problems as the crop up. It would be useful for the students and teachers in terms of having a more standardized and usable interface.
