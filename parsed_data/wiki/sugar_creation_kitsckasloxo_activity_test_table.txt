How To Test
On your PC:
Download
ASLO-4.iso
from
http://people.sugarlabs.org/Tgillard/ASLO-4.iso
Burn CD from <ASLO-4.iso
Transfer the contents of the CD to a 2nd 1GB USB ASLOxo stick.
Boot a Soas USB or a running Soas CD
Insert ASLOxo USB into a USB slot, wait for it to mount.
Select the Journal on top of Sugar's Frame.
Drop down to bottom-left corner of screen, the Frame will retract and show two USB icons.
Select the 2nd (right) USB (ASLOxo).
Drag-drop the desired application.xo (hold down the left button and drag the entry) from the listing into the sugar-journal on the bottom (left USB icon) corner of the monitor OR double click on application.xo in the list of the ASLOxo USB.
The Activity should:
Start normally;
Shut down normally;
Collaborate (if that is an enabled feature);
Resume from the saved Journal;
All behavior should be identical to a download in Browse from activities.sugarlabs.org (ASLO)

Restore 3

[82]
A
Activity to restore the Journal content from Journal entry bundles (JEBs) like those written by the Backup activity.
Supports any data store from 0.84 on, including those with version support. You can use Backup to dump the contents of one data store and use Restore to import them into any other data store.
Only entries older than what's in the backup will be overwritten, so it's safe to run it multiple times and even import backups from other (non-malicious) users.
