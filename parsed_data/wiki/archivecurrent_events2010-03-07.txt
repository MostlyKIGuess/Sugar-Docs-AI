Sugar Digest
1. Tomorrow (Monday, 1 March) is Triage Day for the next Sugar release: Sucrose 0.88. We'll be meeting on irc.freenode.net channel #sugar-meeting at 14UTC (9EST) to review the open tickets for the 0.88 milestone. We'll also look at tickets from previous milestones that have remain open. The goal is to prioritize tickets based on their severity and their impact on our learning mission; we will subsequently allocate resources to the most important tickets; the milestone on some tickets will be reassigned to 0.90.
There are many ways to contribute to the triage effort: feedback from the Sugar users in field about priorities is especially important. Of course, we'd also like to hear from you if you'll have time to help with coding.
Please join us.
