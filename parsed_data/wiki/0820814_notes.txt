Instructions to test in olpc joyride
The sugar packages from Sucrose 0.81.4 went into the olpc image
joyride-2129
. You can update to joyride using
olpc-update
or a usb key.
There are no activities in the builds any more. You can get the Sucrose 0.81.4 activities and many other interesting activities with
bert's activity update script
).
Note:
This script will fail for the Browse activity - since we had a change in the activity name. The error will note that the activity is already installed.
Workaround: Remove ~/Activities/Web.activity and unpack the downloaded bundle.
- rm -rf ~/Activities/Web.activity
- unzip Activities/Browse-92.xo -d Activities
Then restart sugar (ctrl+alt+erase). The activity should now be available in the activity list view in the Home view.
