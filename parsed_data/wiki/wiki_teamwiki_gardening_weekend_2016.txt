As pages graduate to the main website, it would be great to mark them as pending redirect and then have
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ExternalRedirect
to autoredirect
Look at loomio for voting
Look at mailman3 and fancy lists web ui
Local Labs
DC suggests consolidating
http://pe.sugarlabs.org/ir/
back into the central wiki as a subpage section; and graduating its core content to
http://www.sugarlabs.org/es
Walter will contact the
Sugar Labs DC
teacher to see if it is still active
SL BAR
3034 Update SL bar
https://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/3034
NOTE: Please add a link to "people" for access to S/L Contributors uploaded files (satellit 05/18/2016)
eg:
http://people.sugarlabs.org/
DC removed people because it is stale and confusing
Accomplish by editing

3047 Adopt SL bar on translate.sugarlabs.org
https://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/3047
Applying
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/MediaWiki:Sitenotice
to the front page of
http://translate.sugarlabs.org/
can be accomplished, if it can be made simple HTML.
Sugar Creation Kit
Sugar_Creation_Kit
is a long page with some great content and some stale content, owned by

Activity_Team
role needs some love, with the migration off of a centralized git-based repository
Gitorious
to diverse GitHub repos has to some extent decentralized a developer and localizer community that previously had a common point of contact.
Who adopts Activities stranded in Gitorious?
How to provide the best linkage for Activity feedback from less-sophisticated users back to developers/maintainers?
Translation_Team
needs direct channels and responsive maintainers to advance i18n and L10n.
Activity pages
It would be highly desirable to develop a template for an activity page.  It should have a box/table that displays all of the information contained (or that should be contained) in the activity.info file.
Can we get wiki pages created for these activities?
Activities/Annotate
Activities/CardSort
Activities/Convert
Activities/Deducto
Activities/DotsAndBoxes
Activities/FavoriteFonts
Activities/FollowMe Butia
-

merge with

(identical?)

branch structure.  I have some major work to do and it is going to be easiest to use wiki markup in the editing process.  This is a very small portion of over all wiki content.
As an administrator, you have full editing rights. (Wiki page protection is limited in resolution to wiki group membership.) --

Indeed, the request is a formalism, not an admin action request, as B'crat, I can pretty much do as I please on the wiki  :-) --cjl
