The most important job of all! Sugar Labs is looking forward to your contribution. To begin, we strongly recommend orienting yourself with the Sugar Labs codebase. Be sure to visit
http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/
and look at the bugs triaged "sugar-love" on the main page. These bugs are tasks that are simple enough for people to orient themselves with the code. (Please add your proposal to the wiki on a page called Summer_of_Code/2010/Proposal_name where Proposal_name is the name of your proposal.)
You can directly benefit a new software developer's coding competency and confidence levels while contributing to Sugar Labs and developing your own first-line management skills.
