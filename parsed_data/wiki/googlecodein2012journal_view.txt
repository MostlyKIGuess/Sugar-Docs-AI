Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Journal view
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Journal_view
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Rather than viewing the details of a Journal entry on a separate page, the idea is to make the details appear in an expandable in-line format on the main Journal view. The look and feel would be more like Google+ or Facebook. Performance will be a major challenge.
Task
Implement a prototype of a unified Journal view.
