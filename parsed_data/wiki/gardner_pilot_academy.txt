Gardner Pilot Academy
Boston Public Schools - Allston -
http://www.rabbitnet.net/gpa/
(not working as of 2010-03-10)
GPA is partnering with Solution Grove and Sugar Labs to pilot
Sugar on a Stick
.
The Gardner Pilot Academy is the flagship full-service community school within the Boston Public Schools (BPS). The school's vision is to educate the minds and develop the characters of all students in partnership with families and community.  To achieve this GPA provides high quality teaching along with a range of social, emotional and enrichment programs delivered by means of partnerships with an array of community organizations and individuals. Over the past twelve years, GPA has developed strong associations with four universities, several health and mental health agencies, the YMCA, and various organizations teaching visual and performing arts.  As one of just 20 pilot schools in the BPS, GPA is exempt from district mandates. Therefore, GPA has autonomy in the areas of budget and personnel, along with the freedom to implement innovative curricula, assessments, and interventions.
Located in a culturally and linguistically varied section of Boston, the GPA serves quite a diverse student population. GPA's 336 students and their families speak more than 13 languages ranging from Spanish to Khmer (all of which are supported by Sugar). Demographically, 15.2% are African American, 59.1% are Hispanic, 10.7% are White and 13.1% are Asian. Over 85% of the students meet the federal poverty guidelines for participation in the Free or Reduced Price Lunch Program. The majority of GPA's students fall within a group of students considered to be academically at risk.
GPA is located only a few blocks from Harvard Business School and so is convenient for project development participants who may be students at one of Bostonâ€™s many universities.
The school currently has a single computer lab with older computers running Windows 2000. We will be soliciting donations of used equipment from local business to supplement these existing resources.  Sugar can be used at all elementary levels and curriculum areas.
What we learned about what we need
to do to improve Sugar on a Stick
Next Steps
Current computers at GPA
A computer lab with about 20 EVO D500 1.7 GHz Pentium 4, 500 MB RAM computers running Windows 2000
20 new Apple laptops in a mobile cart, a.k.a. a
COW
, (OSX, GPA
Student Macbooks hardware details
, no Parallels)
Each teacher has a MacBook with Parallels 3.0
There are two teachers in the school especially interested in starting with Sugar:
4th Grade teacher who wants to do portfolios
Science Teacher who wants to pilot with the 5th grade to support a new district mandate for writing in Science
Prep for the Fall
Classes Start Sept 10th.
We are putting computers into the 4th grade classroom on Sept 4th.  This is our first experience
preparing donated computers
for Sugar on a Stick use.  We will use the wiki to record our experiences so its easier for the next deployment.
What do we want to ask for?
A workshop run by the kids we worked with in the fall.
To have open computer lab hours during whatever time parents might visit the school
To run an afterschool Sugar club?? How many days per week? - YES from 5-6pm any day.
ToDo
Solicit Stick Donations
Parent communication letters
Backup and Restore
New Stick format
VM for the Macs
The Summer Program
Classes run from July 6 to Aug 17th from 8:30 am to 5pm.  The lead teachers over the summer work 10am to 5pm during the school year so we will have good continuity.  Here is a
calendar
with GPA events.
They will not be using the mac laptop cart and the summer teachers do not have macbooks.
We will be using the computer lab and we will be talking to the school about putting more computer into classrooms and other locations.
2nd Grade
Next Tuesday we will work with the 2nd Graders on their science and social studies. The theme of the week is responsibility and the environment.  They will be learning about their community and preping for a cleanup of the local Charles River.
The goal of the first project will be to label a map of where they do the clean up with what they find during their cleanup.
After kids get their keys and boot up, enter their name and colors we will have them go to Turtle Art.  We will prepare maps and preload them on the sticks and show them how to bring them into Turtle Art.  Then we'll show them how to have the turtle label them.  Next week, after their cleanup they can label what they find on the clean-up.

3rd Grade
We are hoping that the kids can create a US version of the Uruguay geography/facts game.  Any ideas on how to make that easy to do? The vision is they will learn things in class then make them into questions to put into the game.  We will meet with the third grade on Thursday afternoons.

Sugar Computer Lab Lesson Plans
This section is intended to prepare lesson plans and give details on classroom interactions for the school year starting in September, 2009.
After defining lesson plans here, we can quickly extract SW features and bug fixes which will facilitate this classroom interaction.
Other lesson plan suggestions
Please add links to other lesson plans for Sugar which have worked well. We welcome any plans or ideas for any subject, grades 3,4, and 5 for use in the fall at GPA. Just add a link to your lesson plan here and we will consider if/how we can incorporate it in to the work at GPA.
Context
10 - 20 4th grade kids will come to the computer lab once a week for an hour. Each kids gets a USB stick with SoaS and all of their previous work on it. The sticks are kept by the Sugar volunteers and brought back to class each day.
Two teachers and 2 - 4 Sugar volunteers participate in the class. One Sugar volunteer leads the class as the primary teacher.
About 1/2 hour before the class begins, the Sugar volunteers insert the USB sticks and boot each computer. Connections and network neighborhood are checked to see that each boots and they can collaborate.
At the end of class kids are asked to shut down their computers and after they leave the Sugar volunteers collect the sticks.
The class starts with the kids sitting on the carpet. The Sugar teacher projects their screen on a projector and talks about the plan for the class. Typically the kids do an interim step on the computer (e.g. find your computer, start activity n, use it a little) then they go back to the carpet for more direction. Sometimes there are several interim steps and the kids go back and forth from the carpet several times.

Liabilities
What is the school's policy on photos of students/teachers being taken by anyone in the class?
What is the school's policy of video of students/ teachers being taken by anyone in the class?
Are grades based on students producing electronic work? If yes, how is the school securing copies of same?
Are parents aware that their children are being involved in an experimental piece of software?
Have they given consent for this?
Cognitive abilities
How have the students been pre tested before Sugar roll out?
If you don't have study numbers you will not get administrators or superintendants elsewhere to EVEN consider your project. Test early, test often. If Sugar is good, then it'll show in the tests...right? If it doesn't show up in the tests then Sugar, in its current form, in America, will never see too many public schools. All funding comes from test scores... courtesy of

Critical Path Technical Issues
#75
Backup and Restore of user data on a USB Stick - We need to be able to reburn the sticks with new code without losing student work. Also sticks are failing and kids are losing their work.
There had been a problem with cloning sticks that had been booted (in order to load drivers and add journal content). It is necessary to delete the owner keys and the user profile data as per
rm ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
rm ~/.sugar/default/gconf/desktop/sugar/user/*

#74
Clone a Stick. Let a teacher customize a Sugar Stick then clone it, without files or personality, for students to use.
Can't get Computer Lab Machines to Boot from USB
- The BIOS says it should be trying to boot from the USB but its not looking at the USB. A google search confirms that this is not a sugar problem, its an EVO D500 problem.  I'm hoping we find a solution.
#599
Google Search on EVO D500 usb boot gives this result:

Boot Helper Floppy - This is easier then a CD because the computer has to be turned on to open the CD Drawer and put in the CD then you have to turn it off again and reboot.
#597
#579
We have several donated computers. A requirement for the donations was that we wiped the harddrives.  Thus it would be great if we had  an installable operating system enabled quick user switching between USBs. This is also impacted by
#907
, described below.
#598
and
#907
. One way to enable faster switching between Windows and Sugar is a Virtual Machine solution that will allow students to put in their USB Sticks and use all the personal data from the Sticks so they can use any computer.  To do this we need to change the way we put data onto the USB and use different partitions for the boot and the data (Ticket
#907
).
