Title: Activity Library/Devel/Roadmap
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activity_Library/Devel/Roadmap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented as activities.sugarlabs.org (Sugar Activities Library)
There is now
http://activities.sugarlabs.org
, based on the "Remora" code powering
http://addons.mozilla.org
.
May 2008 Proposal / Suggestion
I've been thinking about a better portal for downloading activities. I
came up with some ideas, that I unfortunately don't have time to
implement, but I would be happy to cheer someone on if they are
inspired by this... For the record,  --

It should be easy to upload an activity (specifically after the first time it has been done) - easier than uploading to the wiki.
Activities should be categorised according to various properties, including:
The usual activity metadata from activity.info
Descriptions, as in
olpc:Activities
Category, as in
olpc:Activities
Age ranges the activity is suitable for? (Possibly a Mature category for Doom?)
how will this be filtered to prevent misuse?

I think site administrators would keep an eye that activities are classified appropriately. I had in mind some categories like age 6-8, 8-10 etc but perhaps that should not be determined so finely. However stuff like spreadsheets could be described with an older child type of category.--

Competencies required: Pre-reading, reading, writing, ...
Development maturity
like sourceforge: planning / pre-alpha / alpha / beta / stable
Collaborative?
yes / no / only (for activities like Connect or Chat that don't function as a single user activity)
Requires Internet? (e.g. Gmail)
Compatible with: Sugar / Glucose version or OLPC release or distro release... e.g. Sugar >= 0.81
Additional Dependencies (e.g. video-chat-activity needs extra RPMs not in a build)
Tags
Languages - pulled out of the .xo
Low power friendly?
Related activities (for suites or alternatives)
Screenshot
Activities have Releases, which have status similar to the development maturity - Suitable for: development / QA / public release etc - and of course the downloadable bundle for that release...
The site should be internationalisable using standard i18n tools.
Bonus points for:
Publishing a text page like
http://mock.laptop.org/repos/local.update1/XOS/index.html
at predictable URLs that lists activities compatible with a given release, for easy downloading with scripts etc.
Publishing the source in public distributed revision control, to get easy contributions to code / templates
Deployment on a system that is monitored and actively sysadmined
Implementation in a Python web framework, to tap into the existing developer communityÂ :)
A catchy name...
