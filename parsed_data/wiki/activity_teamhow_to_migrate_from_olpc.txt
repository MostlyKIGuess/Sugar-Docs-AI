Migrate the code
If you are not the author of the activity,
query
the author to let them know about the move.
Create
an account on
http://git.sugarlabs.org
and
log in
. Add your public SSH key to
your account
.
Create a new project
(
http://git.sugarlabs.org
, projects, new). Make your project name lowercase, e.g. pippy, turtleart, paint. Put it in
category "activities"
.
Clone
your activity from
dev.laptop.org
.
git clone
git://dev.laptop.org/projects/pippy-activity
If
you want to migrate a non-master branch...
git remote show origin
git checkout -b sucrose-0.82 origin/sucrose-0.82
Push
to git.sugarlabs.org with something like:
git push gitorious@git.sugarlabs.org:sugar/mainline.git --mirror
Clone
the project from the new repository in order to be able to push your changes.  You'll need to do a git clone into an empty directory, using the same URL you used with your previous push:
git clone gitorious@git.sugarlabs.org:sugar/mainline.git sugar
If you're getting a message saying
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
that probably means that this URL is incorrect.
Set up SugarLabs services
Add
the pootle user as a committer (from the "add committer" link on the mainline page) and send mail to
dirakx
to point pootle to new remote.
Upload a xo bundle
to
activities.sugarlabs.org
.  Be sure to include a couple of screenshots of your activity in action.
If your activity is part of Fructose,
upload a .tar.bz2
to
download.sugarlabs.org
.  Request a shell account from the
Infrastructure Team
if you don't have one already.
Update the OLPC wiki page
for the Activity, noting the migration. Use the
Migrated to sl.o
template.
Change sugar-jhbuild
to point to the new repository if this activity was included in sugar-jhbuild (enter a ticket in
http://dev.sugarlabs.org
if you have no access).
Ask an
Activity Team Coordinator
to create a
Trac component
for your activity.
Notify the community
Notify
sugar-devel
and
OLPC devel
about the move.
Transfer or resolve
existing tickets
related to the code in the
OLPC Trac
.
Update pages on wiki.laptop.org that contain
stale links
to the OLPC repo and latest bundle.  (e.g. Activities/All , the OBX box on the activity homepage, etc.)  See
olpc:Maintaining activity web information#Migrating activities to SugarLabs
Tag
the activity at
Activity Team/Activity Status
as
migrated
.
Clean up wiki.laptop.org
Adjust the activity's old wiki page on wiki.laptop.org:
Put the {{
Activity migrated to sl.o
}} template at the top of the old wiki page.
Clean up the information on the old wiki page.  You can either continue to update the "OBX" badges and semantic information on it, or remove most of this information.
You need to continue to maintain the activity's "activity template fragment"(s) on wiki.laptop.org such as
Activities/Etoys (latest)
.
