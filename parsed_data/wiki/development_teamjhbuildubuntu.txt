Supported versions
Ubuntu is currently unsupported
because all recent versions lack at least one important package (
python-xpcom
).
Prerequisites
In order to install sugar-jhbuild, you need git-core and subversion.
Installing dependencies
After installing and updating sugar-jhbuild according to the
common instructions
, you can use this invocation to install all dependencies automatically:
./sugar-jhbuild depscheck -s | sudo xargs aptitude -y install
Significant bugs
broken D-Bus security configuration
that prevents sugar-emulator from working (because Xephyr cannot work).
sugar-emulator doesn't work properly if the X server uses evdev as keyboard driver
(because of a Xephyr bug).
python-xpcom missing
(and thus Browse cannot work)
Potential pitfalls
gtk-recordmydesktop may prevent sugar-emulator from working properly
