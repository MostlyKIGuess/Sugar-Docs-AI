Sucrose 0.84.0 Release Notes
Announcement
This is the Final Release in our 0.84 development cycle! Thanks to our testers the developers were able to bring in bug fixes to stabilize the platform. And the translators were busy to get all the strings translated. All the details what have changed from a user point of view will be handled in the detailed 0.84 release notes.
Thanks everyone for your great contributions!
Compatibility
When you upgrade a computer that was running previously Sucrose 0.82,
The old datastore will be updated to the new format.
Your old profile (in
.sugar/default/config
) will be imported into GConf
If you later downgrade from Sucrose 0.84.x to an earlier version,
The datastore is incompatible, so all data in the journal won't be accessible (but will be still there)
You will be prompted to enter a new name and color like it would happen on first boot
Most of the activities in Sucrose 0.84.x should be compatible with Sucrose 0.82. An exception is Browse, which depends on new versions of Hulahop, Read which depend on the latest version of Evince and Write which depends on the latest version of libabiword.
