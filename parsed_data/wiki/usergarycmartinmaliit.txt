Maliit OSK style and layout design
Oldest mockup designs are at the bottom, most recent work at the top. Read from bottom to top if you are interested in the design progression. Styles (colour/shading) are much more easy to change than key layout, as layout changes need to be applied to 40+ xml files for each supported language. See the
screen shots
of each language layouts for the currently implemented state.
Mockup dropping esc, tab, ctrl, and alt. Added a slight contrast edge pop, outline style keyboard close icon.
Version with grey keys and white letters, this is lower contrast but may provide less 'visual strobing' of rows of high contrast keys
Experiment in adding an extra row of more conventional keys used by Sugar, note that this keyboard in portrait orientation is borderline at ~9.5mm per key width, landscape is fine at ~12.6mm.
All white keys, no special treatment for modifiers.

Moving return and backspace key to more conventional keyboard locations (maliit layouts target phone sized devices). Added language switch key and hide OSK key, added extra right side shift and ?123 keys. The asdf row needs to allow for the extra Ã‘ key as found on Spanish keyboards.
Simple clean up of the style removing gradients, colours, and the unused keyboard ribbon to maximise space.
Original olpc-xo style and layout provided by the maliit developers.
