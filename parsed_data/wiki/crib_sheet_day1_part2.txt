Review
What we demonstrated.
Show/Hide Frame happens by the action of the cursor.
Hot spots at corners
and
edges of the screen to activate/hide frame. Behavior is of
easily variable
sensitivity.
You don't need to memorize the function buttons - the F1 to F4 keys on your keyboard, lie directly under the respective icons on your screen.
A reminder of what the four icons represent.
We gave instructions on how to change cursor behavior in My Settings => Frame.
Did you notice?
F6 locks/unlocks the Frame, but also allows you to glimpse the Frame briefly.
