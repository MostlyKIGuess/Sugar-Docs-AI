How to test?
Use the GNU standard autogen, configure, make, and make install steps.
Or, use the Sugar Live Build dated 20171009 with Sugar 0.112;
can be booted from hard drive, flash drive, and optical media, automatically starting Sugar without persistence,
can be installed as a virtual machine, with persistence and password protection,
contains a special libabiword-3.0 to fix a flickering Write activity (#4915), thanks to Simon Quigley (Ubuntu #1574278)
is based on the
Debian
9 Stretch Live Build, but does not contain EFI Secure Boot support or encumbered firmware,
for developers, contains all build dependencies, configured source trees (git clones in /usr/src), and binaries (make install) for the Sugar 0.112 Sucrose modules and the Fructose activity set, making it easy to use for GCI or GSoC tasks.

Debian

Debian Source Package sugar
.
Ubuntu
We are waiting for Debian to package Sugar 0.112, then it will be available in Ubuntu.  Check the
Ubuntu Source Package sugar
.
Fedora
Fedora has packaged Sugar 0.112 for Fedora 28.  Check the
Fedora build system
.
OLPC
OLPC packages Sugar for OLPC laptops.  People with OLPC laptops can test Sugar 0.112 now.
The OLPC Sugar packages contain extra commits:
remove frame animation, and transition box, as they are too slow for OLPC XO, but the changes were not accepted upstream,
manufacturing support (About my computer; CPU, disk, memory and wireless firmware specifications).
This makes the OLPC Sugar packages an incomplete test of Sugar 0.112, but sufficiently close to be useful to the community.
Ubuntu 16.04 on OLPC NL3
For OLPC NL3 laptops, using Ubuntu 16.04, use the OLPC packages, like this:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo service lightdm restart
Fedora 18 on OLPC XO
For OLPC XO laptops, install OLPC OS 13.2.9.
Or, for older versions of OLPC OS in the 13.2.x range, update only the Sugar packages to 0.112.olpc.x, like this:
sudo yum update sugar*
sudo service olpc-dm restart
