Percentage of completion: 10%
Detailed Description
Several requests have been made to be able to set the language and keyboard during the intro dialog. (Deemed especially important for SoaS.)
Benefit to Sugar
Our users speak many languages and with Sugar on a Stick, deploy on many different--unpredictable?--keyboards. This feature would allow them to set their language on initial boot rather than having to wait until they have completed the intro dialog. (Note that on an XO, the manufacturing data is used to set these fields. This feature would be used to override those settings.)
Scope
The change would be restricted to sugar/src/jarabe/intro/window.py. The logic used in the control panel would be replicated here.
We also need new icons for the module-keyboard and module-language to be put into sugar-toolkit/src/graphics/icons/scalable/device.
How To Test

User Experience
Users will have the opportunity to work in their native language from the initial experience of Sugar rather than having to initially wade through English-language menus.
Dependencies
None
Contingency Plan
If we don't complete this feature, it can be left out. Nothing else depends upon it.
Documentation
This is common practice now on several GNU/Linux distros, e.g., Ubuntu 9.10
