Linux
Sugar depends mostly on Open Source, GNU and Linux. Sugar supports Linux Operating Systems like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc. The Sugar On A Stick (SOAS) is built primarily based on Linux Kernels and Fedora Operating Systems. The installation methods on some of the most popular Linux distributions are given below
Fedora
Fedora is an operating system based on the Linux kernel, developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat. -- wikipedia.org
In relation to Sugar, Fedora is a downstream distribution project that can be used to run Sugar.
Using Sugar as a Desktop Environment
Install Fedora. Then, in a Terminal, type:
sudo dnf groupinstall sugar-desktop
Then restart your computer. At the Sign in select the Sugar desktop.
Using Sugar with another Desktop Environment
Select the GNOME on Xorg or GNOME Classic desktop, then in a Terminal, type:
sudo dnf groupinstall sugar-desktop
sudo dnf install sugar-runner
sugar-runner
Sugar will start. Logout from Sugar to return to the desktop environment you were previously using.
Sugar is also available from Activities search in GNOME.
Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Gnome as its default desktop environment. -- wikipedia.org
In relation to Sugar, Ubuntu is a downstream distribution project that can be used to run Sugar.
Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan Ermine)
Sugar 0.112 can be installed with the following commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sucrose
log out,
log in with the Sugar desktop selected. For detailed instruction steps, or issues faced during installation on Ubuntu 19.10, proceed

Ubuntu 19.04, 18.04, 18.10
Sugar 0.112 is in the universe repository, and can be installed with the following commands:
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sucrose
log out,
log in with the Sugar desktop selected, for Home View on 18.* use F3 key. For more informatiom, click
here.
Debian
Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. -- debian.org
In relation to Sugar, Debian is a downstream distribution project that can be used to run Sugar.
Using Sugar 0.112 on Debian =
Sugar 0.112 will be available in Debian Buster.
Using Sugar 0.110 on Debian
Sugar 0.110 is available in Debian Stretch:
Install Debian Stretch in the usual way, see
debian.org
, and debian-installer,
when asked mid-way through install what to include, deselect all,
when the install has completed, log in, install Sugar, a display manager, and reboot,
sudo apt install sucrose lightdm
exec sudo reboot
in the graphical login screen, change from the default X session to Sugar,
log in as your non-root user, created during install.
Arch Linux
Sugar OS can be natively installed as a desktop environment on Arch Linux. Arch Linux delivers its package, which can
be installed with ``pacman``.
sudo pacman -S sugar
Also see
Arch Wiki on Sugar
for more information.
NOTE: Manjaro Operating System redirects here. Manjaro Linux is built on top of Arch Linux. The installation is the same
Windows
As Sugar OS is primarily based on Linux, it is not currently possible to run sugar natively on Windows. However, sugar includes support for Windows system in the following ways:
Use a Virtual Machine to run Sugar OS seamlessly. See
Sugar VM WikiPage
Use alternative ~ sugarizer, on
sugarizer wiki
Mac OS
MacOS offers options to install Sugar OS
Use BootCamp on Mac devices to dual boot to Sugar SOAS. See instructions on installing systemless
here
Use a Virtual Machine. Using Virtual Machines on Mac is highly efficient due to its high processing speed. This complements the normal PCs in running multiple VMs. Refer to the
Sugar on VirtualBox guide for Mac OS.
Install a side-by-side Fedora OS, and follow the instructions given
here
Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi are a series of small, low cost, low power computers.
Sugar can be run on a Raspberry Pi. You will need a display, keyboard and mouse.
As of August 2017, the best to use is Sugar on a Stick, as it has many activities and has regular security updates. See
Sugar on a Stick
for how to download and install it. Sugar on a Stick is a spin of Fedora.
Other methods are;
using
Fedora
,
using
Debian
,
using
Ubuntu
.
Developers may focus on either Fedora or Debian when setting up a development environment for Sugar on Raspberry Pi, because Sugar development on generic computers is focused on those operating systems.
