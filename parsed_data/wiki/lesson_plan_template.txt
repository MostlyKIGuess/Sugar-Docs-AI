Overview
Lesson Summary
Briefly describe the procedures and purposes of the lesson.
Estimated Duration
Include an estimate of the time needed for instruction.
Commentary
Any important, up-front-visible comments should go here.
Assessment
Pre-Assessment
Identify strategies to pre-assess student knowledge of the selected standard(s), benchmark(s) and indicator(s). Data from pre-assessment helps educators select specific instructional strategies and determine appropriate complexity and pacing for the lesson. Pre-assessments may be as informal as a reflection on studentsâ€™ prior learning, a conversation about concepts or warm-up problems at the beginning of class that are not scored. They may be more formally structured, such as a quiz or an assigned writing topic.
Scoring Guidelines
Define scoring guidelines for the pre-assessment, which may take the form of teacher judgment, a checklist or another scoring format. Scoring guidelines should reveal whether or not student has met the indicator or benchmark so that instruction can be modified and targeted to learners accordingly.
Teachers should conduct ongoing teacher assessment and student self assessment throughout instruction. These can be planned or conducted as opportunities for observation or reflection arise. If planned, describe here.
Post-Assessment
Identify strategies to assess student learning as a result of the lesson. Data that results should help to plan subsequent instruction.
Scoring Guidelines
Define scoring criteria for the post-assessment, which may take the form of a rubric or another scoring format. Scoring criteria should reveal whether or not student has met the indicator or benchmark so that instruction can be targeted accordingly. If possible, assessment and scoring criteria should be developed to reflect student process as well as product.
Instructional Procedures
Describe the instructional steps that will be taken to implement the lesson.
An introductory lesson plan
might comprise
:
Brief overview of what might be possible with each Activity
Introduction of one or two key functions
Exploration time -- encourage sharing between participants, particularly when they learn something new
Introduction of another key function
Exploration time (as before)
Discussion - how do they see using the Activity with their students
Create a project/sample lesson plan from good ideas in the discussion
Step 1
Step 2
Step 3
Etc
Materials and Resources

Adaptation and Connections
Differentiated Instructional Support
Describe how instruction can be differentiated according to learner needs, to help all learners either meet the intent of the specified indicator(s) or, if the indicator is already met, to advance beyond the specified indicator(s).
Extension
These are ideas for all students to continue learning on this topic -- in class or outside of class.
Homework Options and Home Connections
Describe work that will be assigned to students outside of the classroom.
Interdisciplinary Connections
