Summary
This is the initial release of
Sugar Server Kit
project. It states the fact that basic ideas and core implementations are settled down. This release should not be treated as a release that is ready to use in the field, but see the
Looking forward
section.
Conception
Sugar Server Kit
is not a final solution for school servers in the filed but rather a set of components that do its work on its own. They might be composed to the final solution basing on particular needs of deployments of distributors.
Read the following documents to know more:
Architecture
Statement of purpose for releases
Components
The components that were initiated at that time:
sugar-server
The deamon that provides basic sugar related services, like anti-thief support or Journal backup.
mace
The mace is a tool to make final configuration using source templates. Mace is supposed to help with configuration of services on Server based school servers.
sugar-server-templates
This component contains configuration templates of basic services that need to be installed and configured on bare servers at school. It is possible to peek at some of these services in a downstream solution to apply using the
mace
utility. See the
demoxo
demonstration project for example.
sugaroid
It is a library and application that mimics regular sugar client behaviour to help with testing
Sugar Server Kit
components and
Sugar Server Kit
based solutions.
prosody-sugar
Sugar specific plugins for
Prosody
, lightweight Jabber/XMPP server.
sugar-server-demoxo
This is a demonstration of a
Sugar Server Kit
based school server solution. It is intended to be run on XO-1 laptops to demonstrate how a
Sugar Server Kit
based downstream solution might look, but that's only
one of the possible ways
it might be applied.
Getting the release
There are no source tarballs released since it is not production targeted release and it is not yet clear what deployment model will be eventually useful. For now there are only version tags in
git repositories
.
In any case, the easiest way to try new project is
setting up
school server on a XO-1 laptop. There is also
instructions
how to setup it in Fedora-14 environment on a XO-1. This
Fedora-14 binary repository
might be also used to install particular component for singular usage.
Binaries were built only for Fedora-14 distribution because current usage is only Fedora-14. Sugar Server Kit is distribution agnostic project and new distribution builds will be supported on purpose.
Looking forward
The next minor,
1.1
, release should:
be the first release that will follow the
releasing plan
,
have reliable set of internal automatic tests of all
Sugar Server Kit
components,
reliable set of system integration automatic tests of
Sugar Server Kit
components using
sugaroid
application,
documented on development and deployment levels,
have at least one production deployment.
