Summary
Switch some parts of Sugar to use Gtk+ widgets instead of HippoCanvas, which has no accessibility support.

Current status
Targeted release: 0.86
Last updated: August 14th 2009
Percentage of completion: 100%
Detailed Description
Gtk+ widgets implement support for some accessibility features, but Hippo Canvas doesn't. Particularly the list views in the Journal and the activity list are implemented in Hippo Canvas and could use instead Gtk+ widgets.
Benefit to Sugar
It will be easier for integrators of Sugar to provide solutions with a wider range of accessibility features.
Scope
The change affects only the shell.
How To Test
Features/Improved Accessibility/Testing
Use the activity list and the journal and check that you can do everything you used to.
User Experience
This should be only noticeable to people using a screen reader or other components that make use of the accessibility features of Sugar. Scrolling in the journal should be a bit smoother.
Dependencies
None.
Contingency Plan
None necessary, revert to previous release behaviour.
