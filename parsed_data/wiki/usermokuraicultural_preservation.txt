Using the built-in camera on the XO, children can take pictures and videos of everything important in their culture, creating a cultural archive for themselves. They can then decide what parts of that archive are appropriate for sharing with the outside world. Some of this material will have commercial potential. We have to teach the children and their communities how to sell what they want while maintaining control of their Intellectual property rights. --

I think this will have a lot to do with localization. The software industry does this a lot with for example new versions translated from English. It works linguistically, but not culturally. For example look at differences in websites and you can see some are very blunt and in your face, other cultures have much more layers and menus followed by sub menus.
For OLPC we need to be aware that for example in Japanese schools its common for children to be partnered with each other and so that they work in tandem on order to get better grades. In many Anglo settings this would be considered cheating. How partnerships and software and programs are designed for a partnership or group work may differ.
XO software is being designed for collaboration. We will have to discuss changes in
Educational Curriculum
design worldwide. --

We need to consider how OLPC works in small group settings as opposed to self directed individual learning environments. How will in apply if students are at different levels. Say advanced level and beginner? Informal learning compared with formal study sessions.
This is particularly necessary for computer subjects, where many of the children will soon know more than the teachers. --
