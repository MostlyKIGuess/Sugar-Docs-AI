Sugar is high-quality software for learning, especially by younger children.
Sugar is designed for use by people who do not yet have regular or reliable internet access.
The Sugar Desktop runs on inexpensive desktop and laptop computers that have modest capacity, such as the XO-1 "$100 Laptop" developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC).
A web-based version is under development for tablets and phones, called Sugarizer.
Sugar Activities are applications that run in Sugarizer or the Sugar Desktop.
Sugar Activities encourage learning through self-discovery and encourage collaboration, expression, and reflection.
Sugar realises the educational vision of Seymour Papert and Alan Kay by providing a low floor and no ceiling.
Every Sugar Activity respects every user's freedom to run, study, modify and redistribute it using software licenses compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3 or later.
Sugar development began in 2006 at OLPC, and in 2009 Sugar Labs was established in service to the Sugar community as a volunteer-led and non-profit project.
In 2016 the Sugar community is global, and we at Sugar Labs aspire to include users and contributors in all countries, all languages, and all cultures.
We facilitate knowledge and software sharing among all people; we relate the software freedom movement to education.
We provide plans for how to best use Sugar to improve learning, intended for individual parents and teachers all the way to national policy.
We raise funds and use them to accelerate the progress of our Members, enabling them to access laptops, travel, and more.
We make things to think with.
