Why I got involved
I had read about the OLPC project a couple years ago and thought it was interesting, especially the hardware. Ever since seeing what the XOs looked like, I had wanted one to experiment with and see what I could make it do. When I first heard about this class, I was really excited because we would get our own XOs to use.
