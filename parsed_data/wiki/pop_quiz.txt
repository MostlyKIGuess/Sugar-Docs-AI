PopQuiz is a tool primarily for teachers, to allow informal testing of students in real-time. The teacher poses questions to students on-the-fly, students answer over the mesh, and results are immediately gathered and displayed to the teacher.

other uses
but pop quizzes are the main focus.

Recent Updates
9/6/2010
Changed a lot of stuff.
Right now the program runs on an XO 1.0 using sugar version 0.88
It's not compatible with anything earlier due to python library dependencies.
The networking stuff is still stubbed out but isn't fully implemented. That's to be tested shortly hopefully.

Successfully recreated GUI's from TK to GTK+
GUI development is functional
Beginning work on Mesh Networking
2/23/10
Decided to switch our GUI from using Tk to GTK+ after some input from the community
2/13/10
We made some rapid progress in networking and packaging. Current action items:
Work out remaining kinks
SVG Icon isn't being picked up
On starting activity PopQuiz appears to either freeze or take an unacceptably long time to load
1/27/10
We solidified our goals and plans for this quarter. Within the next week, we plan to have a minimal but functional application.
The student interface will just show an image while waiting for an update from the teacher.
The teacher's interface will first be assumed to be used on the XO. It will immediately open the question-creation dialog, followed by a waiting screen similar to the students'. When all students have responded, text statistics will be shown.
The network backend will be kept as modular as possible to interface with other tools in the future.
Question: will this tool be used for actual testing, or less formal evaluation?
Flash Prototype
If you are a teacher and want to evaluate my project, please either click
here
or look just below to run the prototype. It will launch in the same window, so when you're done hit the back button to get back to this page. Please read the prototype notes as it explains what each screen is for. Once you're done running it, please go
here
to discuss it (or once again look below). The latest version is where you would add your input. If you need any help or would just prefer to individually contact us feel free to contact any of the team members.

Pictures/Concept Art
Upadted screenshots coming soon...
Early Mock-Ups
This is a concept for the final screen in the prototype. It will have the XO names right below the symbol, and the symbols will be highlighted red or green based on whether or not they answered correctly. Hovering over the XOs for a little bit will then show additional information like the last screen in the prototype. There should be back buttons added to go back to the previous screen as well as a 'ask another question' button and a 'end questioning' button.
Future goals
Eventually, this project is going to be a program for the teacher to use to test students on their knowledge of math. The results will then be displayed to the teacher. The results will include things likeÂ % of users that answered the question correctly. A graphical display of what all of the submitted answers were and how many of each student picked that answer. The average time of student answers. And finally, a graphical display of all the students in the activity that when hovering over any particular student, will show the individual statistics about the student.
This will help the teacher learn quickly what the weak points of the class as a whole are, as well as each individual student. With this knowledge the teacher easily determine what topics require more time for the students to learn. Teachers will be able to run the activity and students will be able to join. Hopefully we'll figure a way to efficiently connect somewhere between 10-15 students to each teacher.
Also, currently the project will call for the teacher to input the question, answer, and amount of time to be given to the students to answer. Ideally the
schoolserver.rit.edu
will be able to host 'packets' of pre-made questions that the teacher can download and use.
Alternative Use
PopQuiz as a program also lends itself to quick tallies of opinion where a show of hands is unclear (do we play duck-duck-goose or dodgeball?) fun, impromptu polls between students, guessing games, etc.
