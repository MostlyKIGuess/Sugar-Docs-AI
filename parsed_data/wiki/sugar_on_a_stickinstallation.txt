SoaS installation on USB/SD devices
with Microsoft Windows
There are three ways to do this:
1. Burn a CD-ROM disc, boot from it, then run the script,
livecd-iso-to-disk
Use
Windows 7 built-in Disk Image Burner
or a free utility, like
ImgBurn
, to write the downloaded Sugar on a Stick .iso file onto a blank CD.
Insert a USB flash drive (or SD Card
Notes
) with 2 GB or more of free space into your computer.
Boot your computer
with the CD-ROM disc.  You probably need to press F1, F10, F12, Esc, or a similar key as the computer starts up in order to set the boot source for your computer to the CD-ROM device.
A successful boot will take you into
Sugar on a Stick
.  You can From there, open the Terminal Activity,
, from the
Home list View
.
Switch to run commands with 'root' user permissions by entering
su -
on the command line.
Change the working directory, by entering
cd /run/initramfs/live/LiveOS
Verify the USB/SD
s
csi
d
rive node name (such as sda, sdb, etc.) and partition (such as 1, 2, etc.) for your USB/SD device.
It would look like, for example,
/dev/sd
b
1
.
The
df -Th
command shows your device filesystem on a device node, for example, /dev/sdb1, mounted on a directory
mount point
, such as /run/media/liveuser/<USBdeviceManufacturer>
You should see something like the following:
[root@localhost ~]# df -Th

Unmount the USB device filesystem with this command:
umount /run/media/liveuser/
MyUSBdiscMountPoint
, where
MyUSBdiscMountPoint
is
SanDisk
in the dropdown example, above.
Execute this command line: Â (Substitute the
/dev/sd

, below, with the node name you determined in step 7, above.)
./livecd-iso-to-disk --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb

500
and
800
size values, above, are suitable for a 2 GB USB device. For a 4 GB device, one might use
1000

1600
megabytes instead.)
The installation transcript should look like the following:
[root@localhost LiveOS]# livecd-iso-to-disk --overlay-size-mb 500 --home-size-mb 800 --unencrypted-home /run/initramfs/livedev /dev/sdb1

Installing boot loader
Target device is now set up with a Live image!
Shutdown the physical machine.
Reboot your computer
from the newly-installed Live USB with Sugar on a Stick.
2. Use Fedora Live USB Creator
(This installation method is NOT recommended for LONG-TERM usage of Sugar on a Stick!!  Catastrophic data corruption may occur when the USB stick gets full!
See why.
)
Download the Live USB Creator from
Fedora
.
Insert a USB flash drive (or SD Card
Notes
) with 2 GB or more of free space into your computer.
Launch Live USB Creator.
Select Either
1) the 'Browse' button to 'Use existing Live CD' and find the downloaded .iso file image on your system.
2) Download Fedora and select  Fedora-SoaS-{i386|x86_64}-{22|23}  (This automates the download and checksum routine and directly  burns to the USB/ SDCard
Adjust the Persistent Storage slider. This enables you to save changes to the system and additional Sugar Activities onto the device. (aka persistence file or Overlay --this space  by default is write once  only)  --see below for  additional way to make /home a  rw overlay
Select your flash drive as the target, and click the
Create Live USB
button.
With the latest version of Fedora LiveUSB Creator you have TWO (2) option for burning method
1) CP (non destructive) -- meaning you can still use the unused space on a larger (8-16-32-64Gb) usb for whatever post burn.
2) DD ( the old school way) Note:  THIS WILL destroy any previous data make sure you properly  select the drive to use AND make backups of any pre-existing important data (you will not be easily able to retrieve overwritten data)
Wait for the process to finish, then close the Live USB Creator program.
Stop your flash drive with the
Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media
notification area icon dialog, and eject it.
See a
screenshot tutorial
for this.
See a
video
of an earlier version of this process.
3. Launch a virtual machine with the Sugar on a Stick .iso file, then run the script,
livecd-iso-to-disk
Download and install
VirtualBox
(for example; you could do something similar with another vm).
Create a new virtual machine.
Choose Linux for the Operating System and Version Fedora (64 bit) if available, or Fedora, on systems lacking 64-bit functionality.
Attach the Sugar on a Stick .iso file as a CD in the Storage Section
Insert a USB storage device into your physical computer and enable the VirtualBox USB controller.  Then add a filter to recognize the inserted device in the USB section of the VirtualBox machine setup.
Start the new virtual machine.
Verify that the USB device is recognized in the running virtual machine.
Your device appears in the hover box for the USB stick icon in the virtual machine bottom frame.
df -Th
shows your device filesystem on a device node, for example, /dev/sda1, mounted on a directory
mount point
, such as /run/media/<AccountName>/<USBdeviceManufacturer>
You should see something like the following:
[root@localhost LiveOS]# df -Th

Continue from step #4 in the
Burn a CD-ROM disc
section above.
Shutdown the virtual machine.
Reboot your physical computer from the newly-installed Live USB with Sugar on a Stick.
Notes
A Secure Digital (SD) card may not be marked as a bootable device. To check this, use these instructions at a Linux terminal or console:
Check the disk partition table for a device, such as
/dev/sdc
,
sudo fdisk
-l
/dev/sdc
<----that's a lowercase letter 'L' for the
l
ist option.
You should see something like the following:
$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc

Create a mount point directory:
mkdir /run/soas
Mount the .iso file to make it accessible as a disk:
mount
/path/to/downloaded
.iso /run/soas/
(Where
/path/to/downloaded
.iso is the
filesystem
path, or fully specified name,
of the downloaded .iso file.)
This is the source for the installation, and must remain
mounted
until the installation is complete.
Insert a USB stick of 2 GB or greater capacity into your computer.
With

for more details.)
Note
: The graphical Liveusb-creator is an alternative installation method (see the first Windows
method
), but it does not create the separate home.img filesystem, and so, the write-once persistent storage on the disk is more quickly consumed (see
LiveOS image
). If the USB device does not boot after running Liveusb-creator, the command
liveusb-creator --reset-mbr
may help.

SoaS on VirtualBox
See instructions from the
VirtualBox
page (transcluded here):
VirtualBox
With
VirtualBox
Â®
one can run
Sugar
on Microsoft Windows, Intel-based  Apple Macintosh, or GNU/Linux host computers from within a virtual machine window.
See this
VirtualBox overview
. VirtualBox is a large software installation with many features and operating system options. A
User Manual and other documentation
is available online. Those who have not used VirtualBox before, might find it more easy to understand and install than expected.
VirtualBox Downloads:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
(See
VirtualBox/Technical
for some collected details.)
The following instructions are intended for those Learners interested in using VirtualBox to run Sugar.  The process is not fully mature as the technology is evolving both in the VirtualBox and operating system software.
Online IRC support is available from
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/IRC
Various VirtualBox experiments may be found on the
discussion page
.
Install VirtualBox
on Mac OS X
Follow the instructions on the VirtualBox
Downloads page
for Mac OS X.
on Microsoft Windows
Download from
http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
.
on GNU/Linux
Use the VirtualBox packages available in your GNU/Linux distribution.  For example, on Ubuntu, it is available in Ubuntu Software Centre.
Or, use the most recent packages from VirtualBox, see
Linux Downloads
.
Also, see
Talk:VirtualBox
page for experimental installation variations.
Setup a Virtual Machine for Sugar on a Stick

Issues
Activating the Frame might be a little difficult. The lower 2 corners are easiest and you may want to configure edge activation in the My Settings > Frame panel.  With VirtualBox Guest Additions installed (see
here
), only the bottom edge and corners are available for Frame activation.
On Mac keyboards, you might wish to change the Virtual Box default key for switching the Sugar cursor to the normal one, as the default key (control right arrow on Mac keyboards) is trapped by Sugar. (Windows and Linux keyboards use Right Ctrl.) You may do this change in File/settings of the Virtual Box menu.
