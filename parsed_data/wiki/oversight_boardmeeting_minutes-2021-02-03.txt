Sugar Labs Monthly Events Discussion
Claudia and Walter plan to do a March event. Details still TBD
Fedora 34
Alex and Ibiam have been busy getting Sugar 118 ready for the next Fedora release. They have collaboration working again!!!
Alex mentioned that he has been running Sugar on some low-end hardware and it works great except for video in Browse. (Video on the same hardware on FF works fine.) He suspects it is related to hardware acceleration. Anyone interested in investigating?
Other Business
