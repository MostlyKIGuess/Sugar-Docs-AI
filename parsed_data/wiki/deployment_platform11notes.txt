Summary
This is the first Sugar Server Kit release that is being positioned as ready for use in the field, thanks to the
Paraguayan pilot program
. This release should fulfill needs similar to those faced in Paraguay. The next step will be proving this system for restricted environments within the
Server on an XO
project for SSK-1.2.
This is also the first release that is following the
Sugar Server Kit release plan
.
Design changes
Changes made from the initial,
1.0
, Sugar Server Kit implementation.
Unified API for sugar-server
The major way to interact with sugar-server for now, is a
RESTfull API
. The API inherited from the OLPC XS is preserved when it is possible, e.g., except Journal backups that were implemented differently from the beginning.
sugar-client
The
sugar-client
project is intended to be the only one on the client side to cover all possible interactions with a school server.
Clients are identified by profile UIDs on a server
In comparison with the 1.0 implementation, and the OLPC XS, as well, sugar-server-1.1
identifies
clients by a UID that is unique for the particular user's profile, i.e., not by the XO's UUIDs. This was done to cover use cases where the same hardware is being used for several learners.
See the
design overview
for more details.
Final solution
This release is entirely based on experience gathered during the work on the Paraguayan pilot program, i.e., the functionality of Sugar Server Kit was improved and proven by using it in a school. As a result, the
paraguayeduca-server
, the final Sugar Server Kit based solution, was created.
It covers the full life cycle of using school servers in environments similar to Paraguay, i.e.:
Install Kit on USB stick to:
install new server,
migrate from existing installation,
migrate from existing OLPC XS installation;
Post-install school server automated tests;
Initial setup for the Mothership to support new school servers;
New client side behaviour based on sugar-client.
Supported platforms
LTS versions of Trisquel-4.1 (Ubuntu-10.04) GNU/Linux distributions.
Fedora-14 will be added to supported platforms in
1.2
to provide
Server on an XO
solution.
Components
In comparison with the
1.0
release, there are the following changes:
sugar-client
a new component to interact with a school server on a client side;
sugaroid
was renamed to
sugar-unit
to expose the more general purpose of this project;
sugar-server-demoxo
was removed as an Sugar Server Kit component and will return as a supported
final solution
in
1.2
.

full list
of Sugar Server Kit components.
Getting the release
Sources in tarballs can be found on
package.sugarlabs.org
and in
master-1.1
branches in repositories on
git.sugarlabs.org
.
Binaries for supported distributions can be found on

Looking forward
The next,
1.2
, release should contain the following major features:
collecting
usage statistics
,
return sugar-server-demoxo as a full featured Sugar Server Kit
based solution
.
See the
1.2 TODO list
for more details.
