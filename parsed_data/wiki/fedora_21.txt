How to Clear ./sugar
When making a new VM
, to clear the Sugar Journal of old entries and to avoid identity conflicts among copies of the VM, enter the command
rmÂ -rfÂ ~/.sugar
in the Terminal activity. Then shutdown the VM. This will clear all Learner information on the VM and let you start with a fresh install. Skipping this will result in collisions in the Neighborhood view of the Jabber network between separate copies of the appliance. Verify the presence of the
.sugar
directory by entering
lsÂ -a
in Terminal.
When cloning a customized VM
, in order to keep the Journal and installed .xo Activities, use
rmÂ -rfÂ ~/.sugar/default/owner.key*
in the Sugar Terminal, and then
shutdown the VM
. enter in root terminal:
su (password) shutdown -h now
This leaves the Journal entries and removes only the previous Learner's identity key files.
To clear the Sugar Journal
:
rmÂ -rfÂ ~/.sugar/default/datastore
This may be needed if the Journal becomes clogged with too many entries.
USE WITH CAUTION'

1-) detect screen resolution and properly display GUI
2-) run in compatability mode (run as administrator)
3-) run as

4-)Fix the Download button on the GUI to work and be up to date."

Virtualbox guest additions 4.1.20 fail with desktop integation (only a ~1000 pixel horizontal resolution can be achived). Mouse integration and shared folder integration is OK.

The application is super simple to use, just insert the USB storage devices you want to write to make show up in the MultiWriter interface, then press a single button to choose the ISO and MultiWriter will image the ISO to all those USB drives."

Answer:
that location service is not related to NetworkManager connectivity checking
location service is used by weather application for example, possibly  clocks ... to determine your location
Question:
not Captive Portal on/offÂ ?
Answer:
no there is no easy on/off switch, it is still a hard dependency  as package, but you can for example create a same config file in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/99-connectivity-fedora.conf  for example with "blank" uri  "uri="  and  "interval=0" that will override the default 20-connectivity-fedora.conf  (man 5 NetworkManager.conf    CONECTIVITY SECTION ... )
Answer:
here is a upstream bug report about making the easy "on/off" option available (or some other solution)
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737362
also that URL will always return OK if it is "real" so no MITM, its content wont change in any way when local settings are changed, it is only used with known content and accessed over secure connection  to verify you have access to the internet ...  (in case of MITM, it will fail, because certificate for fp.o cannot be valid assuming CAs don't allow someone to create one for that domain ... and they "sign it") "
Fedora Firewall
"sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=FedoraServer
That will limit it to SSH, DHCPv6 and cockpit
Or use default zone "Public", which swaps cockpit out and adds mDNS
sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=block"

AppInstaller in F21

"gnome-software will support installing system add-ons such as fonts and codecs. It will show additional metadata for applications: screenshots, ratings, other details.
We will also work with the Fedora infrastructure team to obtain the metadata online for all applications instead of shipping it statically for a limited set."

"This all came out of a number of proposals at Flock 2013, 
including Architecture for a More Agile Fedora and Stephen Gallagher's suggestion that we use that architecture to design, build,
and market three distinct Fedora products. This grew into a proposal accepted by the Fedora advisory board, and the formation of Initial Working Groups by FESCo. "
