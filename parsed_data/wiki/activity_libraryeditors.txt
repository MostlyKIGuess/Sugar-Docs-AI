Introduction
The Sugar Activity Library leverages volunteer reviewers/editors to look over pending and nominated activities for publication on the site. With the launch of
activities.sugarlabs.org
(ASLO) and the sandbox, aspects of this role have changed significantly.
In ASLO, anyone is considered a reviewer. Users can install activities as soon as the author submits them. We hope that these users will then return to write a review of their experience with the activity, whether it be good or bad.
What's an editor?
Editors have access to the queue of pending and nominated activities, and their main role is to assess the existing reviews and determine whether the activity should be pushed to the public side based on criteria in the
Policy
.
What should an editor do?
Subscribe to the
editors mailing list
to be informed of all review threads.
Follow the
Activity Library Policy
before pushing activities to the public.
