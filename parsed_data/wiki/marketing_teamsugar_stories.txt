Please add suggestions to the bottom of this queue - a note on why they're good to profile and how to get in touch with them would be a huge help too. I'll work down from the top; others are welcome to help interview as well. Deadline March 13, in time for the 0.84 press release. Let me know if you have questions or want to get involved.
