What is a SL project?, team?, lab?
Congratulations to Sebastian and Laura
Finances
We are putting all of the finances in the wiki as per
Oversight_Board/Finances/2010-10
. We agreed to dedicate a meeting to reviewing our financial processes and strategies; also a meeting to discuss our marketing and fund-raising strategies.
What is a SL project?, team?, lab?
We discussed and voted on mchua's
motion
Oversight Board/Project Motion
Discussion:
One benefit of being a project (or team or lab) is the possibility of Sugar Labs engaging in fund raising.
It was pointed out that these decisions could be handed off to the Marketing Team and recommended that the Oversight Board divest itself of so much centralized control.
Ir was pointed out that infrastructure support could be offered informally, irrespective of any Oversight Board decisions.
Motion passes:
5 in favor
2 opposed
Sugar Love
