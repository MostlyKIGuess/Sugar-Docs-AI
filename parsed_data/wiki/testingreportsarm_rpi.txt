Information;

Sugar IRC-10 in RPi "B" 512 on rpfr-f18-rc1 (arm) and rpfr-17-xfce-r2 use IP6 ...all my other devices use IP4
...
In general newer versions of Fedora will try and autodiscover IPv6 networks.
If it finds one with a non-local (not fe80::) IP address it will get on it, and used the IPv6 routers spotted if present
Given a DNS name with both IPv4 & v6 addresses set, it's mostly up to the application to see if asks the OS to do v4, v6,
or just generically whichever the OS thinks makes the most sense

RECOMMENDED
http://scotland.proximity.on.ca/raspberrypi/test-releases/rpfr17/
Changes in this release:

- Image resize/swap space creation is now more reliable (note, however,
that it will take several minutes after the firstboot setup before the
resize/swap takes effect - the system may be used during this time). I
think we've probably nailed the last of the significant
firstboot/resize/swap issues.

- The image is now 1.852G in size and will fit a 2GB card (4GB or larger
card is recommended to allow plenty of space for data/extra
software/swap). The download is 665MB.

Next week we'll start performance tests with armv6 rebuilds (sfp & hfp)
and continue work on image size reduction and boot cutdown.

"Mike Thompson has produced a publicly available SD image of Raspbian that is bootable on Raspberry Pi hardware.
This is called the "pisces" image as that is what Mike's Raspberry Pi system is named on his LAN.
This image is a little newer and includes a more complete installation of Raspbian and LXDE than the more minimal Hexxeh image.
This image was created using the Debian installer so it reflects a minimal Debian installation with the LXDE packages added for a desktop."
