Sugar Digest
1. Google Summer of Code 2015 is wrapping up. The students have been writing their final blog reports, submitting last-minute patches, and uploading their code to Google. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our students and their mentors for all their hard work this summer. (Also, thanks once more to Google for supporting this program.) Great strides along many fronts were made. Specifically,
Michaël Ohayon worked on Web versions of some core activities for the Sugarizer project: Calculate, Paint (with collaboration, Record, and Memorize. He also submitted patches to Turtle Blocks to make it compatible with Sugarizer. Michaël's [blog
http://sugarizingparis2015.blogspot.fr/
] and git [repo
https://github.com/mikklfr
] are worth visiting. (Mentor: Lionel Laske)
Yash Khandelwal worked on Music Blocks AKA Mouse Music. This is a powerful, playful model for music in a block language. Yash's [blog
[1]
and git [repo
https://github.com/khandelwalYash/Music-Blocks
] are also worth visiting. (Mentors: Devin Ulibarri and Marnen Laibow-Koser)
Ishan Sharma revisited the Turtle 3D concept, rewriting it in Javascript. His results ([blog
https://turtle3d.wordpress.com/2015/08/24/final-update/
], demo and git [repo
http://ishan28mkip.github.io/turtle3D/
]) are robust, scalable, and extensible. (Mentor: Walter)
Amit Kumar Jha worked on extensions to Turtle programming this summer. He added argument passing and return values to procedures, passing arguments to and returning values from Turtle programs so that Turtle Blocks can be used for in-line programming by all Javascript activities, and he developed a unit=test framework for Turtle Blocks JS that can be extended to all of our Javascript activities. See his [blog
http://sugarlabs-artista.blogspot.in/
] and the master Turtle Blocks JS [repo
http://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/
] for more details. (Mentor: Walter)
Richa Sehgal worked on a framework to support off-line Web programming, an interactive Javascript shell. She's submitted patches to the upstream Browse activity. Meanwhile, checkout her git [repo
https://github.com/richaseh
]. (Mentor: Tony Anderson)
Vibhor Sehgal and Utkarsh Dhawan, although not officially GSoC students, worked with Tony and Richa on a parallel project, [Web Confusion
https://github.com/sehgalvibhor/WebConfusion
], a series of programming challenges in the spirit of Turtle Confusion to encourage students. (Mentor: Tony Anderson)
Abhinav Anurag made some progress on a Web collaboration framework for our Javascript activities. See his [blog
https://summerofcode2015.wordpress.com/
] and [code

]. (Mentors: Martin Abente and Lionel Laske)

7. Peter Robinson announce quite some time ago that the [Sugar on a Stick 21 Beta
https://fedoraproject.org/get-spin-prerelease
] is now out as part of Fedora 21 Beta ([Details
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2014-November/003238.html

8. Also worth mentioning again: Ruben Rodriguez released Trisquel 7.0 released. [TOAST (Trisquel with Sugar)
