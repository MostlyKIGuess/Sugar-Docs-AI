What about metadata properties with binary values such as the previews?

Any field in METADATA file can have _file suffix, in that case content of this field(substring w/o _file suffix) will be fetched from file inside of the bundle; so in case of preview, METADATA could have field "preview_file=<file-inside-of-the-bundle>"
Already considered having each property in its own file like we have in the current DS layout:
Development_Team/Datastore_Rewrite
?

dunno, for hand made bundles(like libraries) I guess its not very useful, for system made bundles(while uploading Journal objects for example) there is no critical difference between all-metedata-items-as-files and METADATA-and-some-fields-from-files
