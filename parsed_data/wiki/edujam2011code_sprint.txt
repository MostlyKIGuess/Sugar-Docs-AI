--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right after the
eduJAM! 2011
, we had the Sugar Code Sprint to work on deployment needs detected during the summit.
On Sunday we had a
brainstorm session
to triage bug reports from the field.
This day was historic: For the first time the Sugar Labs Obersight Board could meet with 6 of 7 members (didn't find the minutes in
