Alternate to netinstall (bfo.iso)
As of 06/27/2015 boot.iso fails and lives only boot in EFI; so we need to have an alternate installer to test rawhide builds.

starts in fedora server
Change source to:

f22 Cinnamon live spin
5/2/2015
I would like to submit a Cinnamon spin for review and possible inclusion in future Fedora releases, though I am sure it is too late to include in F22. It is a spin simply using the Cinnamon desktop environment group, and I have been working with the Cinnamon maintainers to fix any issues that have come up in F21 or F22 beta. The proposed spin page is here:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cinnamon_Spin
The kickstart files are available in this repository:
https://github.com/Grinnz/spin-kickstart-cinnamon
I have uploaded ISOs for both F21 and F22 beta here:
