--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugar Labs adheres to the principles of Free Software. An
overview of these principles
is provided by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has a
set of guidelines for Free and Open Source software
that characterize the intentions of our community.
All software and content distributed by Sugar Labs, including activity bundles uploaded to
http://activities.sugarlabs.org
, must be released under a license that conforms to the principles and guidelines referred to above.
You may use any license on the Fedora Project's
list of Good Licenses
or the FSF's
list of Free Software Licenses
. If you wish to use a license not on one of these two lists and believe that it fits our guidelines, please contact the
Oversight Board
.
This policy was determined during a
2009-12-11 board meeting
and clarified at the
2011-06-09 board meeting
. Additional feedback and discussion is found
on the Talk Page
.
Please contact the
Oversight Board
if you have questions about our licensing policy.
