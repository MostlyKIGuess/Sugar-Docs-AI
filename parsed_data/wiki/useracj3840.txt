Information
Interested in creating a tool for teachers to ask students questions and receive stats quickly about the answers. It will allow user input for asking as well as answering questions and will show things like the percent of students who answered correctly, name the students who answered it wrong, show the answer that the students who were wrong chose, and show the average answer time. |this will be moved to project page once created|
