Buddy Tags Mock-up
Edit Your Tags in "About Me" Panel
Add your self tags to your public profile via a new input area in the "About Me" control panel.
Other Buddies See Your Tags
From the Neighborhood zoom view, other users can hover over your buddy icon to reveal a palette displaying a list of your self tags. Note: left (or right) clicking any buddy icon should immediately reveal the full palette.
Other Buddies Can Search Neighborhood to Filter
From the Neighborhood zoom view, other users can enter search queries to filter down to specific buddy tags.
Palette Adjusts Size to Fit Buddy Tags
There needs to be a reasonable upper limit on the maximum number of tags allowed, but within reason, the buddy palette should adjust size to show tags.
