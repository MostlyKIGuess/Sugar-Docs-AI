I'm currently a student, and in my spare time, I'm learning Python. I just happened to stumble across the Sugar project after a friend asked my about the OLPC effort. Since Sugar is written in Python, and I'm learning Python, I thought that this would be a great project to learn from and also help to contribute to.
