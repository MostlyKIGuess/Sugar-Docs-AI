What would be the mission of a regional Sugar Lab? How would it differ from the global mission?
The overall mission of sugar labs has to remain the same in a regional sugar labs, the changes are more related to the way that local organizations and people interact with a regional sugar labs, the regional sugar labs must be a way to foster, and hardening the sugar labs overall mission.
What would regional Sugar Labs like/need from the global Sugar Labs community?
We can set up <your-region>.sugarlabs.org as a regional support organization under Sugar Labs.
We can help provide you with infrastructure support such as a mailing list and a wiki.(personal mail addresses @region- sugarlabs.org?)
What sort of financial help are you looking at?  Sugar Labs should be able to help with grant writing, etc.
