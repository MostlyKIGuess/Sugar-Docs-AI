Background
Many of the newer devices that Sugar runs on have built-in accelerometers. But few Sugar activities take advantage of accelerometers. (Exceptions being
Activities/FractionBounce
and
Activities/TurtleArt
.
Task
Investigate how Sugar could better leverage the use of an accelerometer. How could it be built into the Sugar toolkit, e.g., into the Sugar Games engine (the Sugar wrapper for
pygames
)?
