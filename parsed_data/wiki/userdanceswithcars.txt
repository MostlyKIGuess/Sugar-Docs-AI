Could have sworn I had created a Danceswithcars wiki.sugarlabs.org account before...
Was it deleted, in the other namespaces, or am I getting senile (not a vote here...)
Anyway, see
DancesWithCars
for more bio background and OLPC related info.  And yes, I know OLPC is not SugarLabs, but it spawned and the user base is there, even if development is going in a different direction...
