Install Sugar
The easiest way is installing sugar from
native packages
.
If your favourite GNU/Linux distribution doesn't provide sugar or contains out-of-dated packages(in most cases you don't need latest minor release(like 0.82.1, 0.84.1), the good practise is looking for the last major release(0.82, 0.84)) you could consider possibility to use
sugar-jhbuild
- the system used by core developers to build sugar from last git sources.
As an activity developer in most cases you need only
glucose
module(its included to
sugar-glucose
or
sugar
packages).
If you want to create your own activity
What you need to do to create or share your activity.
Start coding
Create
an account on
git.sugarlabs.org
and
log in
. Add your public SSH key to
your account
.
Create a new project
(
http://git.sugarlabs.org
, projects, new). Make your project name lowercase, e.g. pippy, turtleart, paint. Put it in
category "activities"
.
Initiate
your project
You can copy/paste
Hello World
activity to get an example of usual files hierarchy.
Place your activity to ~/Activities/
activity-name
.activity directory.
To test your activity in sugar environment:
use
sugar
command to run sugar as a regular window manager
use
sugar-emulator
command to run sugar in window mode(in Xephyr), could be useful to test your activity in current environment without re-loginning.
Consult with
Activity Team/Resources
to get useful links,
Development Team/Almanac
could be a good start page
Start
coding :)
Share your activity
If you want to share your activity for broad audience:
Open a ticket on
bugs.sugarlabs.org
to create component for your activity e.g.
#788
Using
setup.py
from activity root directory, create .pot file
Add
the
pootle
user as a committer (from the "add committer" link on the mainline page) on
git.sugarlabs.org
Open a ticket on
bugs.sugarlabs.org
to add your activity to
pootle
(sugar translation environment) e.g.
#810
Upload a xo bundle
(use
setup.py
to create bundle) to
activities.sugarlabs.org
.
Be sure to include a couple of screenshots of your activity in action.
Nominate
your activity to the public
Create activity page
wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/<activity-name>
keep in mind that page on
activities.sugarlabs.org
targeted to users and page on wiki targeted to more experienced users and developers
Join the Activity Team
The Activity Team is newly formed and we are seeking members.
If you would like to join:
Create a User page on wiki.sugarlabs.org if you have not already.
Copy your SSH public key into your User page.
Add a link to your User page to
Activity Team/Contacts
.
Subscribe
, and send an email introducing yourself to sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org.
If you are an independent developer who is interested in working on a Sugar activity, please introduce yourself and your project in an email to sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org.
Help the Activity Team
If you'd rather just start coding
right now
, it's easy to do!
Check
Activity Team/TODO
for ideas to work on.  To start small, pick an Activity Feature Request.  If you'd rather work on something harder, try one of the High Impact Tasks.
If you haven't already set up Sugar, see
Activity Team/Resources
.
Clone the Git repository for the project you picked and register it with Sugar.
git clone <project_url>
cd project_name
python setup.py dev
(Ctrl-Alt-Erase to restart Sugar)
Hack on the source code.
Create a patch file containing your changes.
git commit
git format-patch -1
Email 0001-My-change-description.patch to sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org.
