Shutdown Sugar
Choose
Shutdown
on the pop-up palette menu.
Important
With Sugar on a Stick, wait until Sugar shuts down completely before removing the USB stick.  If you just pull it out without waiting after shutdown, you will corrupt the USB stick filesystem and it will never start again. It needs to write information about your Journal before it shuts down. (Notice, if there is an LED on the USB stick, it flashes for a while after shutdown.)
Re-login to Trisquel after restart
If you encounter a re-start of the Trisquel 5.0 Sugar live CD
caused by a color/name change or other change in
My Settings
that requires a restart,
(NOT the same as the central figure's drop-down menu selection
Restart
on the Home view, which shuts down the CD and ejects it.)
It will come up on a login screen:
(other) <===Click on it
[_______]<==Enter trisquel here
Password:         (leave it blank)
hit (Login)
Sugar will restart with the changes.
