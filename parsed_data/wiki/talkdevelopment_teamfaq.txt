Sugar Activity starting
How can a user start an activity from the command line?
How can a user start an activity from the command line without starting Sugar? Please supply a sample command.
Why? I'm tired of digging around for the error logs. I figured I could do something like
sugar - run pippy 2>pippyerrors.txt
bemasc suggests
less ~/.sugar/default/logs/org.whatever
Note the above command will take some messing around with to get what you want.
I have tried:
user@ubuntu:~/sugar-jhbuild$ ./sugar-jhbuild launch pippy
sugar-jhbuild launch: command not found
user@ubuntu:~/sugar-jhbuild$ ./sugar-jhbuild sugar - launch pippy
sugar-jhbuild sugar: command not found
user@ubuntu:~/sugar-jhbuild$ ./sugar-jhbuild pippy
sugar-jhbuild pippy: command not found
user@ubuntu:~/sugar-jhbuild$ ./sugar-jhbuild run pippy
sugar-jhbuild run: Unable to execute the command 'pippy': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
And the response.
<bemasc> dgd: impossible.
<dgd> bemasc, ?
<dgd> not possible to run activities from jhbuild is that what you mean bemasc 
<bemasc> dgd: sugar activities cannot run outside of sugar, and more than a java applet can run outside of the JVM, or a flash applet can run outside of a flash interpreter.
<bemasc> s/and/any/
<dgd> ok, so running just the activity in sugar?
<dgd> just one activity, none of the home stuff etc.
<bemasc> also not possible
<dgd> I thought for sure I read in the docs that you can run just an activity...
<bemasc> by "not possible" I mean "requires you to modify the code for the Sugar shell".
< bemasc> You can probably cause Sugar to launch and immediately start an activity.  You might be able to do  this using a .xsession script.
<bemasc> However, users will still be able to bring up the frame and switch to the home view, etc.
Where are the activities stored?
Some users will find them here:
/usr/share/sugar/activities/
Jhbuild users will find the activities here:
./install/share/sugar/activities/Calculate.activity/activity
./source/terminal/activity
