I am a 3rd year at RIT, with 4th year status within the Computer Science department, I also plan to complete a minor in Mathematics.
Development Interests:
I am interested in developing for some of the basic mathematical topics like
Add and subtract (up to five-digit numbers) and multiply (up to three digits by two digits) accurately and efficiently.
Divide up to a three-digit whole number with a single-digit divisor (with or without remainders) accurately and efficiently. Interpret any remainders.
Or some of the geometric topics such as:
Compare and analyze attributes and other features (e.g., number of sides, faces, corners, right angles, diagonals, and symmetry) of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes.
Recognize similar figures.
