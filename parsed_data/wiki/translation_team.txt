Mission
Enable users and developers to use Sugar and Sugar Labs services regardless of their native tongue.
Welcome to the Translation Team
Welcome to the Sugar Labs Translation, Localization and Internationalization Team.
The goal of the Sugar Labs translation team is to make Sugar available in as many languages as possible at the highest quality.
We work on a number of translation related projects
Localizing the Sugar Learning Platform
Localizing Sugar Activities
Translating the Sugar Documentation (e.g. FLOSSManuals)
Translating the Sugar Labs wiki. See
Translation Team/Wiki Translation
.
Other translation and localization needs of Sugar Labs
General information
The Sugar learning platform and Sugar Activities are localized at
http://translate.sugarlabs.org/
.
For a quick primer,
http://people.sugarlabs.org/sayamindu/pootleforxo2_5.pdf
is highly recommended.
También se encuentra disponible un
Manual de Traducción a Lenguas Nativas
en Español.
The Sugar Documentation is written in partnership with FLOSS Manual at
http://en.flossmanuals.net/
.  Translation of that documentation uses FLOSS Manual tools.
Language Teams
While Sugar translations are open to everyone to contribute, Sugar Language teams act as quality assurance team. There is one language team appointed to each language.  Language teams often work closely with Sugar Local Labs.
Below is a list of activities associated with localization teams:
Check and review the work of translators
Help new translators with feedback and guidance
Check the translation inclusion into pootle and report problems to developers.
Keep in touch with people from other translation projects (upstream project) and synchronize the translation work, assure same translations do not need to be made twice
Keep in touch with other Sugar Language teams and help establish new Sugar Language teams, exchange best practices with other teams
Resources for Translators
Any Sugar Labs wiki page can be viewed with Google's machine translation service by selecting a language from the wiki sidebar list under 'Google translations'. Translators can help improve that service when viewing a Google translated page by hovering over a sentence. An option to contribute a better translation is provided in the pop-up widget.
Package Maintainers
All UI translations for sugar packages are to be made available for translations using Pootle.
Please tag related bug using "i18n" or "l10n".
