Summary
Sugar Network
UI targeting to content creators and providers, e.g., activity developers or deployment supporters. As well as users who need full-featured access to the
Sugar Network
.
Contributor Hub is designed to be a pure JS application to support as many as possible major platforms (including mobile ones) to run Hub as a local application. Besides, it will be possible to distribute Hub as a regular Web application.
Try it
To start using Contributor Hub on regular basis, try:
Recent
development version
with administrative privileges for anonymous users;
Recent
stable version
synchronized with the
Activity Library
and assumed to be used for testing in the field with anonymous access restricted only for read operations.
Or, look for
another distribution options
.
From development environment,
clone
sources and open
index.html
in a Web browser. Note that by default,
index.html
