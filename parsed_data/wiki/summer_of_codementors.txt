Mentors
Our most important need right now is for quality mentors. If you (or someone you know) would make a good mentor, please nominate yourself (or them), both here on the ML (iaep AT sl.o) and on the wiki (if you can't handle a little redundant paperwork, you're probably not a good candidate :). Include relevant information such as:
Name/contact
Timezone
What kind of projects could/would you mentor?
How much time could you devote to mentoring? Can you make the especially solid commitment of being a double-mentor?
What relevant coding experience do you have (very briefly, two sentences at most)?
What relevant mentoring (or related) experience do you have?
Anything else you think is relevant.
Please also add this page to your watchlist. We will probably later do some kind of "community interview" process where we ask you questions on this page.

What kind of projects could/would you mentor? Telepathy related
How much time could you devote to mentoring? Can you make the especially solid commitment of being a double-mentor? What are your other commitments over the summer?
If possible I'd prefer co-mentoring so I would focus on the Telepathy part and a Sugar guy on the UI/integration one. I'll work this summer but my
employer
would probably let me allocate some time on mentoring if needed. I could maybe have another soc student on the GNOME front too.
What relevant coding experience do you have (very briefly, two sentences at most)?
I hack on Telepathy as my job. Did lot of the Telepathy integration in Sugar.
What relevant mentoring (or related) experience do you have?
Never mentored soc projects but regularly help people on #telepathy and #sugar.
What do you think your role as a mentor would involve? How would you fill it, and why? (3-5 sentences is plenty)
My main goal is to ensure than proposed projects are did the right way. I want to avoid that student did the code on his own without any input from relevant person and so is finally never merged because it was just the wrong approach.

What do you think your role as a mentor would involve? How would you fill it, and why? (3-5 sentences is plenty)
There is a lot to creating learning activities that is not technical but procedure. I am particularly interested in making it easier for programmers to create learning activities.

My entrée into professional software development, which I love, was an internship not unlike the ones you're applying for here.
