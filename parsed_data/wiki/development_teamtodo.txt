Bug importer from trac.laptop.org to trac.sugarlabs.org
tomeu (w/m_stone's help)
We need to do the Big Move of Sugar bugs.  A one-time cost, fortunately.  Ed has agreed that the bugs in OLPC trac will be closed with pointers to the SL trac.
Identifying bugs to move from trac.laptop.org to trac.sugarlabs.org
tomeu, erikos, marco
We need a very *very* high-level assessment of bugs to be moved over.  Basic, *basic* triage from knowledgeable developers.

Logout option
unmadindu (patch), eben (icon), tomeu (review)
