About TurtleBlocks3D
Turtle Blocks 3D is an extension of Turtle Blocks into three dimensions. In addition to moving the turtle on a plane, the turtle can be moved in a three-dimensional Cartesian space.
All of the features from
Turtle Blocks 2D
are present in this version, along with some new ones.
This activity runs in Sugar and also in the GNOME desktop. To run it from GNOME, you will need to clone the repository and then run the executable
turtleblocks-3d.py
.

You can save the 3D objects you create in TurtleBlocks3D as
.obj files
and you can load .obj files generated from other programs, such as
Blender
.
Save as wavefront .obj
Use this button to export 3D graphics to '.obj' format. We currently support points, lines, polygons, and color.
Load wavefront.obj
Use this button to import 3D graphics from the .obj file format (used by many 3D modeling tools). When you click the button, a "Choose an object" dialog pops up; from there, select an .obj file from the Sugar Journal or the filesystem.
Example .obj
It is 3D, So you can also choose where to look from, With the Camera-position option you can choose top, front, left, right, top-left and top-right camera positions!
