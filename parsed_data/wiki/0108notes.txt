Introduction
Sugar 0.108.0 is a new stable release of the Sugar Learning Platform. It was released on February 13th 2016.
What is new?
Collaboration works on newer systems (e.g. Fedora 23) with activities that do not use Tubes (e.g. Chat).
The search box in home view grabs focus automatically.
Changing the Frame settings in the control panel no longer requires to restart Sugar.
Added new keyboard controls to access and navigate the control panel.
The control panel can display the serial number for commodity hardware.
Multiple bundles can be installed at once using good old sugar-install-bundle script.
The shell now claims file transfer channels so Empathy won't interfere anymore.
Custom Home views names can be changed now.
Neighborhood icons are no longer placed randomly.
Sugar can now start even when the disk is full.
More fixes for the Sugar theme.
Many bug fixes.
