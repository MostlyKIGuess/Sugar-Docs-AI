--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Mallard is a markup language that makes it easy to provide user help. It would be a nice feature to add Mallard-like help to activities, accessed through a mechanism similar to the view source mechanism. We need to sort through two issues: integration into Sugar and intergration into our i18n / L10n system.
Task
Design a
Mallard
help system for Sugar activities.
