Information
I am a first year Applied Networking and Systems Administration Major at RIT, second year standing. I have been interested in computer hardware for almost 6 years, including building several desktops and servers. Lately I became interested in the ultra portable laptop market, purchasing an eeePC and becoming interested in the OLPC XO laptop project. I am interested in creating a device that not only helps children learn, but that also exposes them to the same technology that has fascinated me. I want to work on making the XO mesh networks easier and more intuitive than they currently are (small complaints, but it's the part I am most interested in).
