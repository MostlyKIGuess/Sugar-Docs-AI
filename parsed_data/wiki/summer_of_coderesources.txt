GSoC Project Ideas
Are you looking for things that could occupy your time over the summer break? There are several proposals that are looking for some enthusiastic support:
Development Team/Project Ideas
Activity Team/Project Ideas
Sugar Camp, Boston 2008
OLPC:Summer_of_Code/Ideas
OLPC:Category:GSoC_proposals
OLPC:Projects and Proposals
We are also very keen to have a student or two adopt a mature Activity. This would involve completing a set of non-trivial patches for a particular Activity. This is a great opportunity to get to know how others' code is written. You'll be able to show to your future employers that you're able to fit in nicely with a currenty software project.
