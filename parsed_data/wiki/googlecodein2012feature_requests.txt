Title: GoogleCodeIn2012/Feature requests
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/GoogleCodeIn2012/Feature_requests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
We designed Sugar based on nearly 40 years of research in the area of technology and learning, and yet we know that there are many features and opportunities we have missed. Although we engage in regular discussions with our users, we more often get feedback about what we have done rather than what we should do.
Task
Investigate what new (future) features are being sought by teachers and Sugar users.
