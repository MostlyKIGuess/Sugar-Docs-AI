Linux Mint 12 comes with a brand new desktop, built with GNOME 3 and MGSE (Mint GNOME Shell Extensions). MGSE is a desktop layer on top of GNOME 3 that makes it possible for you to use GNOME 3 in a traditional way. You can disable all components within MGSE to get a pure GNOME 3 experience, or you can enable all of them to get a GNOME 3 desktop that is similar to what youâ€™ve been using before.
Of course you can also pick and only enable the components you like to design your own desktop.
The main features in MGSE are:
The bottom panel
The application menu
The window list
A task-centric desktop (i.e., you switch between windows, not applications)
Visible system tray icons
