Summer of Code
I participated in GSoC 2008 with OLPC.  My project was developing a camera and computer vision library.  My implementation was through adding a camera module and several computer vision functions to
Pygame
.  While it is available in the
Pygame repository
, it will not be released until Pygame 1.9.0 in early to mid 2009.
You can track historical updates for the summer with my
Weekly Updates
.
Student Technology Outreach
I am a program coordinator at
STOC
, a club at Carnegie Mellon University.  We are building up an
Activity development team
, and should have some wonderful things out soon.
Activities
Bridge
Daniel Drake and I wrote this during the OLPC Physics Game Jam.  It is currently being rewritten by STOC.
Panorama
Donald Cober and I wrote this during the Yahoo! University Hack Day at CMU.  It is going to be rewritten by either STOC early next year, or me during winter break 2008-2009.
Colors!
I helped Wade Brainerd with the videopaint portion of the activity.  This is something that will be improved upon when I have more free time.
Pointillism
Nifty little camera demo that makes live capture look like pointillism.  It is basically just a demo for the pygame camera module.
