Introduction
These are instructions describing how we run meetings at Sugar Labs. It was originally written for
Sugar on a Stick meetings
and is based on the
Fedora Marketing Meeting SOP
.
Examples
You can see examples of past meetings at
Sugar on a Stick meetings#Minutes
.
Instructions
Make an agenda
Make a simple bullet list of topics to talk about at
Sugar on a Stick meetings#Agenda
- if you need help, ask on the list or on
IRC
for things people would like to discuss.
Announce the meeting
Email the
soas list
with a meeting announcement that includes a link to the agenda. Here is
an example announcement
- it's very simple. There's also a template
#Meeting announcement
you can use.
Run the meeting
Show up on IRC a few minutes early, announce the meeting (say something in-channel like "the meeting is starting in N minutes!") in both the meeting channel and
#sugar
, and then start the meeting with the
#startmeeting
command (just type that into the channel).
See
this log
for a quick runthrough of meetbot commands in action, and
the Fedora wiki's guide to meeting bots
for a full list of meeting commands.
To end the meeting, use the
#endmeeting
command. (Again, just type that into the channel.)
Publish the meeting notes
Once you #endmeeting, the meeting bot will spew out some stuff that looks like this:
21:01 -!- meeting changed the topic of #sugar-meeting to: <OLD TOPIC>
21:01 < meeting> Meeting ended <DATETIME>. 
Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot .
21:01 < meeting> Minutes:  <LINK>
21:01 < meeting> Minutes (text): <LINK>
21:01 < meeting> Log: <LINK>
In other words, the meeting bot:
changes the channel topic back to whatever it was before the meeting
announces that the meeting has ended
creates links to the minutes (in html), the minutes in text, and the full IRC log.
Here's what you have to do:
Take one of the "Minutes" links and add it to the list of meeting minutes at
Sugar on a Stick meetings#Minutes
.
Email the
soas list
with the link to the meeting minutes and a copy-paste of the text minutes. A template can be found at
#Meeting notes to the soas list
; it's taken from
this email
as an example.
That's it! You're done!
