Copying and Pasting
Did you know that you can copy/paste stacks to/from the clipboard? You type Ctrl-C to copy whatever stack is under the cursor to the clipboard. Ctrl-V will paste from the clipboard onto whatever TA project you have open. Try pasting this code into your Turtle Art project.
[[0, "clean", 258, 217, [12, 1]],
 [1, "repeat", 258, 251, [0, 2, 3, null]],
 [2, ["number", 36], 309, 251, [1, null]],
 [3, "repeat", 323, 311, [1, 4, 5, 9]],
 [4,  ["number", 4], 374, 311, [3, null]],
 [5, "forward", 388, 371, [3, 6, 7]],
 [6, ["number", 300], 459, 371, [5, null]],
 [7, "right", 388, 413, [5, 8, null]],
 [8, ["number", 90], 446, 413, [7, null]],
 [9, ["vspace", 20], 323, 389, [3, 10]],
 [10, "right", 323, 463, [9, 11, null]],
 [11, ["number", 10], 381, 463, [10, null]],
 [12, "start", 258, 175, [null, 0]]]
You can also paste text from the clipboard into text blocks.
Note: You can duplicate individual blocks with copy and paste, when duplicating a text block, deselect the text block after copying if you want to duplicate the block rather than duplicating the text within the block.
Speed
Turtle Art has three 'run' buttons:
The 'rabbit' button will run your program at full screen.
Note
: It will highlight blocks during execution, so your program will run much faster if you hide blocks.
The 'turtle' button will run your program with a slight delay between blocks. Block are highlighted as they are executed and block labels are updated with the current block values.
The 'debug' button will run your program with a longer delay between blocks. Block are highlighted as they are executed and block labels are updated with the current block values.
Sharing
Turtle Art supports a simple sharing model. Whomever joins a shared activity will share turtles with the other participants, e.g., whatever any turtle draws will appear on every screen. While sharing, you can also send stacks of blocks from one user to another. Share can consume a lot of network bandwidth, so it is not recommended to share among more than 2–3 people at a time if the screen is frequently changing. As with all Sugar activities, you can use the Share-with feature of the Journal to share your Turtle Art projects with others.
A simple application of Turle Art sharing is multimedia chat. Send text using the Show Block; voice using the Speak Block; and images using the Show Block. Lots of fun.
Note:
Turtle Art will also share between Sugar and GNOME.

This (blue) turtle drew a blue square.
This (red) turtle drew a red circle.

Running Turtle Art outside of Sugar
Turtle Art can be run in the GNOME desktop outside of Sugar.
PC HARDWARE:
Download
Turtle Art
(as a *.xo archive)
Extract the TurtleArt.activity directory from the archive, eg drag it to the desktop
Open directory TurtleArt.activity
Run turtleart.py (run in terminal is better, you can see error messages there)
OLPC XO HARDWARE
The XO1.5 and later software builds for the XO1.0 allow switching between Gnome and Sugar desktops. The following assumes that Turtle Art is already installed in Sugar.
Switch to the Gnome desktop
open olpc's home on the desktop
open Activities
on later software builds, Activities is both hidden and locked, if so, check show hidden files to unhide, in terminal chmod 777 Activities to unlock
open TurtleArt.activity
run turtleblocks.py (run in terminal is better, you can see error messages there)
COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
