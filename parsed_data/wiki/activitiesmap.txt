OurMaps Wiki
OurMaps is a wiki for storing or sharing map markers online.
When many markers are in one place, they are combined into a red "cluster" marker:
It is easy to create a marker and add to the map.  A school can create a private group to collect markers that only they can see.  A public group shares its markers with XO users around the world.
Development
The Map activity was written in PyGTK.  It relies on JavaScript files to interact with Google's Static Maps API and geocoder.
Having the activity work on Sugar-on-a-Stick or emulators is an ongoing problem:
