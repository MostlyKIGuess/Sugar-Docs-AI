Fedora wiki page
mozzila certutil (from irc):
"i tried to import the cacert.org root, mainly for use in chrome
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxCertManagement
chrome uses mozilla's nss database, but for some reason that isn't shared with firefox, so just 
importing in firefox doesn't work
the trick is to set NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql" before running those commands from the chromium wiki page.
chrome stores all the other certs somewhere else, though. the nss db was empty
check your $home folder for .pki folder
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools/certutil.html
should also be a good read."
