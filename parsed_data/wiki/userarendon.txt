Project Ideas
The main goal is to establish the foundations of a Math based Pac-Man game.
The player will take on the role of Pac-man in a maze like environment. Pac-man
will go around the environment and consume two kinds of pellets.  Small pellets
will increment the score while larger pellets reveals a math question on the
screen.  There will also be a number of ghosts in the environment that will attempt
to catch Pac-man.  Each ghost will have an answer to one of the questions revealed
by the large pellets and Pac-man will not be able to consume the corresponding ghost
until the pellet is consumed.  A win is established if all ghosts are consumed.  A loss
is established if a ghost catches Pac-man or if time runs out.  To make the game a
viable learning tool for students, teachers will be able to alter the set of questions
and answers through a simple interface.
Progress
- Established a wiki for Pac-Math
- Chose a team leader
- Weekly meetings to distribute work and discuss progress
- Basic Pac-Math design is in progress
