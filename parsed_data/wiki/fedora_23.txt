Link:
https://pagure.io/fedora-kickstarts/tree/f23
<dgilmore> satellit: I suggest that you tell people to git clone the repo and not get each piece manually
Kickstarts need to flattened before use:
hit
raw tab
and
save-page-as
to a local directory (/home/(user)/Downloads/pagure/)

switch root terminal to the local directory with the kickstart files (/home/(user)/Downloads/pagure/)
ksflatten -v, --config fedora-live-soas.ks -o flat-fedora-live-soas.ks --version F23
NOTE the following command does NOT work in f23
"only url and nfs install methods are supported"
this should be fixed later 06/20/2016
