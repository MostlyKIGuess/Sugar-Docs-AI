Texas Conservatives Win Curriculum Change
.
AUSTIN, Tex. — After three days of turbulent meetings, the Texas Board
of Education on Friday approved a social studies curriculum that will
put a conservative stamp on history and economics textbooks, stressing
the superiority of American capitalism, questioning the Founding
Fathers’ commitment to a purely secular government and presenting
Republican political philosophies in a more positive light.
Texas school board members have reportedly tried to institute Young Earth Creationism in the schools, as well.
