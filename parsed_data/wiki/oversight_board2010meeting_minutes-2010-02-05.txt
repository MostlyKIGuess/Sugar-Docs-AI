.
Action:
cjb and SeanDaly will draft some new TM and run it past the community for review.
We also discussed several new requests, such as a request from Paraguay (PYEDU) for a formal collaboration. Everyone was in favor of such a collaboration and we hope to ratify the TM policy sooner than later in order to proceed.
Google Summer of Code
We discussed the merits and liabilities of hosting a GSoC program and decided that the benefits (community growth) outweigh any downside (distraction to key developers). Tim McNamara has volunteered to help run the program. We still need additional team members.
Action:
Walter to be more aggressive about assembling a team for GSoC
Goals for 2010
We discussed
our goals
and made some preliminary refinements, particularly in reference to defining our goals for Sugar 1.0.
Action:
Everyone will review the Goals for 2010 for next time.
