Gtk3 Hackfest 2011
Two major changes have recently occurred in Sugar's underlying technologies. Firstly, GTK+ 2 has been obsoleted by GTK+ 3, and GNOME is now based on GTK+ 3. Secondly, PyGTK, the underlying Python library that Sugar uses to call into GTK+, has been deprecated in favour of PyGObject Introspection (hereafter "PyGI"). More background info can be found at
Features/GTK3
. Goal of this hackfest is to remove the biggest blockers before we can start the porting and potentially start porting over.

Agenda, goals
Removing Hippo and other custom widgets
Do we do this before or after GTK3? Note transparent window / icon overlapping issue.
migration path to Gtk3 (do we ship two toolkits? Do we migrate the shell and the toolkit and activities at once?)
This is expected to be resolved in advance at
Features/GTK3
.
porting Sugar's theme to gtk3 (go benzea, go!)
Port sugar-toolkit to GTK3 and release sugar-toolkit-0.95.x
Port Read to GTK3
Port Browse to Webkit/GTK3
other introspected libraries that need work (namely NM)
