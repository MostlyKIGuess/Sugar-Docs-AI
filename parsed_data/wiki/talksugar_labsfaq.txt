Sugar Programs
I am very familiar with Linux and I am trying to find something for my 7 year old to get stated on. There are many great things that are offered here but a few I have questions about Sugar.
1. I am downloading programs that are not from the activity page or git-hub that he likes to play I have to go in to the terminal and manually run the program, is there away to make an icon for this.
2. The browser based off of Mozilla Firefox is stripped down to much I installed Firefox and ran from the command line and I could finally view the videos. With the way you have it now you can not view videos it crashes and I think it would be cool if you could provide a kid friendly web browser. KidOz K2 was on to something there that would work great with Sugar Labs.
Android
Does Sugar support Android?
Not at this time, although there are some developers working to change that situation. See this
mailing list thread

Multiple Machines on Network not distinct
I installed Sugar Bluberry on two similar (both EeePC's slightly different models) netbooks from same SoaS.  Gave each unique Names and even changed their hostnames in /etc/sysconfig/network.  They are both connected to same AP and set to use same Jabber server.  However, the two laptops cannot find eachother in Neighborhood.  In fact, they can never see the entire Neighborhood at the same time.  While one sees it, the other goes blank and vice versa.  How do I configure these two netbooks so that they can find and share activities with eachother?
Not sure how you did your install, but if you inadvertently copied the user's public/private keys from one machine to the other, that would explain the behavior you are seeing. Try deleting them (they'll be regenerated at start up) from ~/.sugar/default/ --

Changing the Resolution
_I believe this question is distinct from the one below_ Installed Sugar Bluberry on two nearly identical netbooks.  One detected proper resolution of 1024x600 while other detected 1024x768 resulting in a squished UI.  I tried creating my own xorg.conf (this build includes an X that automates settings detection i take it). However, I just keep bricking the netbook and reinstalling Sugar...  Should I just keep trying new xorg.conf's?
perhaps try xandr from the Terminal? --

Resizing Sugar
I have changed fullscreen mode of Xephyr into 800Ã—600, but now how do I change the size of frames and icons?
You can edit sugar.gtkrc and sugar/graphics/style.py to adjust the sizing parameters.
Note that not all Sugar Activities know about resizing, esp. pygame-based Activities. We are working to improve this. --

Some Dead Links (Not a question)
The links in the section "Does Sugar run on an ASUS Eee PC (or other "ultra-mobile" or "mini" PCs)?" are both dead. I'm afraid I don't know where they should be pointing, and I'm a bit reluctant to delete the question since I'm just a random visitor. Does anybody have current links to the referred to resources? (
