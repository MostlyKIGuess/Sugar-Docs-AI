Organization
Our challenge is to organize the wiki so that communities can find the information they need.
Main Branches
Teams
,
Projects
, or
Local Labs
are the main branches of organization for the wiki. On the wiki navigation sidebar, Teams are listed in the Community block and premier Projects in the Projects block.
See
Sugar Labs
for an overview of the organization.
Each branch may use a
Colored Linkbar Header
to help distinguish and organize their pages on the wiki.  See the legend in the Team Pages example below.
Team Pages
Under the main Team, Project, or Local Lab pages are sub pages as reflected in a colored header,
e.g.
,

Teams in Sugar Labs provide general services in their subject areas across the spectrum of projects.  Team members may be active in multiple areas.  Teams have a home page with links to pages in a team header for participation, contacts, resources, FAQs, a roadmap or their vision, tasks, and meetings.
Project Pages
Organized separately, or possibly under a team, is a Sugar Labs project,
e.g.

Projects in Sugar Labs are generally focused on delivering specific goals within a defined time period.  They may require services from multiple specialties.  Project members may be active in multiple areas.  Projects may have a home page with links in a project header to pages for participation, contacts, resources, FAQs, a roadmap or their vision, tasks, and meetings. As projects mature and meet their goals, some may graduate to Product or Service status, like the
Sugar Activity Library
, others may simply be integrated into the Sugar Learning Platform or our archives of learning.
