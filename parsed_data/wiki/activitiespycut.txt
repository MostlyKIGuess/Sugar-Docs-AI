Description
PyCut is a pizza-making puzzle game made for the IGME-582 final project at the
Rochester Institute of Technology
. This game teaches basic units of measure to children inspired by the Pizza Pass minigame of
Logical Journey of the Zoombinis
(1996).
In the game, you are in charge of pizza creation! You run a popular pizza shop in town and are taking orders from customers. Sometimes you have to take orders for a group of customers too! However, the customers are not precise with their order… they only know what they like and what they don't like. But they can't name the ingredients! You have to work with the customer to make a pizza that meets their exact specifications and preferences. What are those specifications? You will have to figure it out with wasting as few pizzas as possible!
The game intends to be a logic puzzle for 4th graders to deduce a solution based on as little knowledge as possible.
In the added "Advanced" difficulty mode, the puzzle incorporates fractions into the mix.
Current status
The latest stable version of the game can be found on
activities.sugarlabs.org
.
Note
: The stable version does not seem to work for most XO-1s. It works by invoking the main file in Python but not as an XO Activity.

GitHub releases
for latest version
No longer under active development – but pull requests welcome! (And yes, we do respond to them!)
To Do
In the beginning of the project, a few
stretch goals
were identified as extra features that would be nice for us to add if we have time or for future students in the HFOSS course to add if they wish to take our project and improve it.
Additional puzzles
Another way to expand PyCut would be to add multiple types of puzzles, similar to the original Zoombinis game. The question would be whether the expansion puzzles are related to PyCut and tie into a theme, or if it's a larger game with different logic puzzles tied together.
This could also be a project for a future class to take multiple past projects from the HFOSS course at RIT and create a platform title that children could play through, much like a full video game.
