Glucose news
sugar
shell breaks if system bus cannot be accessed
#1403
sugar-emulator: kill X server on exit
#1440
move ~/.i18n parsing from sugar-emulator to sugar
#1441
can't create ad-hoc network when name is 7+ characters
#1604
sugar-toolkit
Sascha Silbe: locate rainbow using PATH instead of hardcoding the location
#1436
Sascha Silbe: don't use rainbow if it has been uninstalled, but the config file remains
#1317
Some distros retain config files after removing packages, so /etc/olpc-security might exist even if rainbow is not installed.
Daniel Drake: Apply activity font settings earlier
#1607
Fixes some minor changes in toolbar appearance that my previous work unintentionally introduced.
sugar-base
sugar.logger.trace(): lots of debug output (silbe)
What is new for packagers
cjson -> simplejson: Sugar moved back to use simplejson instead of cjson. cjson has a big bug dealing with slashes, this is a significant long-term bug and upstream has not been responsive other than acknowledging it. This bug breaks journal entry bundles
#1553
