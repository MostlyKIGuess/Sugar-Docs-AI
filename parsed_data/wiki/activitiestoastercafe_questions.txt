Launching that map in a separate window as of May, 2010 shows 594,000 children in Peru, 480,000 children in Uruguay, 110,000 children in Rwanda, 53,700 children in Mexico, 13,700 children in Haiti, 14,500 children in Mongolia, 6,000 children in Nepal, 6,000 children in Ethiopia and 3,950 children in Afghanistan have XO-1 laptops.
In the US there were 78,000 bought through the 2007 & 2008 G1G1 program. 15,300 children in Birmingham, AL use them.

Where were they manufactured?
Quanta built a facility for the XOs.
Where is the yellow crank?
It turns out this was not a good design for generating power. Leg muscles are stronger and better for humans to generate power or solar panels as used in Peru. This is only feaseable due to the low power requirements.
How long does the laptop last on a full charge?
About 4 hours which is enough for typical school days of the deployments, some of which teach school in shifts, some outdoors.
Even the low power requirements of the XOs would require quite a bit of work to keep them charged. Most deployments charge using eletrical power mains.  Sometimes generators or solar panels are used.
