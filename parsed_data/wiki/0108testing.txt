Testing Sugar 0.108
Please test, and report problems on sugar-devel@ mailing list, bugs.sugarlabs.org, or the discussion page here.
Sugar 0.108 was released on 13th February 2016.
What should I test?
new features, see
feature list
,
bug fixes, see GitHub commits for bug list,
Fedora
For machines running
Fedora
, there will be no 0.108 packages available until Fedora 24 is released.  Fedora does not provide backports of later Sugar to older Fedora.
For OLPC XO laptops, using OLPC OS 13.x (Fedora 18) or 14.x (Fedora 20), use the OLPC packages, and update only the Sugar packages to 0.108.0.olpc.0, like this:
sudo yum update sugar*
sudo service olpc-dm restart
However, the OLPC Sugar packages contain extra commits:
enhance activity favourites
,
remove frame animation,
reduce home view redraws
, and;
remove the transition box.
This makes them an incomplete test of Sugar 0.108.
Other
There are no other distributions that are packaging Sugar 0.108.  On these systems, use the GNU standard autogen, configure, make, and make install steps.
