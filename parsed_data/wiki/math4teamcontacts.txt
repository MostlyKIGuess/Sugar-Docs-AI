Math4 Project Teams
Introduction
Math4 Teams are small teams that concentrate on developing activities that address objectives from the
Math4 Curriculum Chart
.  These teams should consist of 2-4 developers and 2-3 teachers, working together in close coordination to make awesome stuff.
Responsibilities
Team members should be ready to commit to the following responsibilities:
The initial meeting.
Everyone on the team should get together on phone, IRC, or in real life, to set goals.  Which objective would you like to tackle?
The weekly meeting.
Maybe it's weekly, maybe it's bi-weekly, maybe it's monthly -- but team members should agree on a time when they can all get together to assess one another's progress, hold one another accountable for milestones, and generally support one another.
Teachers: defining features and testing code.
Teachers, your primary mission is to tell the developers the kind of things you'd like to see and to help them understand pedagogy and how children learn.  Can the activity be done with minimal supervision, teach a concept, and then test mastery of that concept?  It's your job to direct the developer, and then test the code to make sure it's doing what you think it should be doing.
Developers: designing activities and writing code.
Developers, your primary mission is to listen to the teachers' intent, and then write activity code that expresses that intent.  You should commit to writing your code in the open source way.  That means working together, using gitorious or the like to maintain code publicly, keeping at least a bit of a TODO list, and documenting your code well enough that new developers can pick up and join in.  And yes, that last part isn't always "the open source way," but it should be, and for us, it will be.  :)
Math4 Team Signups
Volunteers!  Please sign up below.  When enough volunteers have signed up, an organizer will be in touch to help kick off your team.
First complete team gets to pick their own, favorite
number set
as a name.
Teachers - If you have never edited a wiki page before, just email the people on your team and they will help you get started.

Math4 RIT Team
This team consists of those working on Math4 projects within the
RIT Honors Seminar
.
They may end up also in a Math4 Prime, Complex, Rational, Real, Fuzzy, Fibonacci, Julia, ... team.

Math4Team UTOS-XO
The
Utah Open Source Foundation
is sponsoring once a month hackfests for the OLPC (XO) 4th Grade Math's Curriculum.
The UTOS-XO team has a
mailing list
to coordinate local activities and development.  We encourage status updates to continue to be on the 4gm mailing list.
So far, we have 11 members of our team.

We will probably divide this team into two geographically located teams for convenience.  Salt Lake and Utah counties tend to be good choices for team borders.  If more folks start appearing north of Salt Lake County, it's possible to splinter a little more.
Status
Currently, we're working on four xo activities from the list:

Created Team for signup purposes
Goal: Recognize classes (in particular, odds, evens; factors or multiples of a given number; and squares) to which a number may belong, and identify the numbers in those classes. Use these in the solution of problems.

We are developing the Hop-A-Round activity. It is targeted at topic 4.N.16-Rounding. I expect we'll post our beginnings on the git server soon. Our goal is project completion by no later than August 2009.
