Introduction
In order to be useful to teachers, it's important to connect activities and content to quantifiable learning objectives.
There are many great, well-established curriculum frameworks that would make this easy.
We are using the
Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics
for experimental purposes.  (As we understand it, this work is public domain.)
The goal: to create at least one activity that teaches each one of these objectives.
Curriculum Framework, 4th Grade Maths
