Setup a development environment
describes a set of scripts to make it easy to build all the sugar modules and some of the required dependencies. Please see the
documentation
.
If you find any issue please report them instead of documenting workarounds on this page. The tips get out of date really quickly and unreported bugs are never fixed. The goal here is to always work out of the box for everyone.
