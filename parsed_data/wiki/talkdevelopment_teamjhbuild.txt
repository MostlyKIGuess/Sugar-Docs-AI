sugar-build
Please use
sugar-build
instead of sugar-jhbuild
got errors as well
Command given on main page didn't work for me either,
but I was able to get sugar-jhbuild from the http link (not git:) in the git repo page...

I just tried
./sugar-jhbuild update
on a new fresh install.  The first line of output seems normal
Initialized empty Git repository in ...sugar-jhbuild/jhbuild/.git/
then it says
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
and gives a traceback.  Any suggestions? --

Seems to be working now, the server must have been unavailable for some reason.  --

Old info
Removed from the page:
In addition to the dependencies listed, you may want to install the
gtk-doc-tools
package (this allowed me to build hippocanvas on Ubuntu Hardy).

gtk-doc-tools is (now) listed as a dependency for Ubuntu 8.10. Hardy's not supported any more for jhbuild as its GNOME is too old. --

If you run into an error during
sugar-jhbuild build
that looks something like "aclocal: macro `AM_PATH_PYTHON' required but not defined" try installing or updating your packages for
autoconf
and
automake
and running
sugar-jhbuild build
again. (worked for me on Ubuntu Hardy)

automake1.9 is listed as a dependency for Ubuntu 8.10. It depends on autoconf, so this should be handled by jhbuild's dependencies. --

"ERROR: Dependencies information is missing (unknown distribution/version)."
This is a new error and doesn't seem very helpful. I'd much prefer the list of packages not detected that we used to get.
ETA
: was able to trick it into continuing by copying a file in config/sysdeps/ over and :
export SJH_DISTRIBUTION='darwin-unstable'

Ubuntu 10.4 hints
There seems to be a conflict with GTK on Ubuntu 10.4. If you get an error message:
Error fatal de E/S 11 (Recurso no disponible temporalmente) en la pantalla «:30»
then check ~/.sugar/default/logs/shell.log to see if there is this error:
.../libsugar.so: undefined symbol: GTK_WIDGET_HAS_FOCUS
If so, try a clean rebuild of sugar-artwork. (I went to extremes to make sure everything built fresh.)
rm -rf ./source/sugar-artwork
./sugar-jhbuild buildone sugar-artwork
Note that there is a problem with hulahop, but this should not impact Sugar other than the Browse activity.
Thanks to Sascha for helping me with this minor roadblock. --
