Swag Orders
This list is to keep track of swag production deadlines and to notify people of current swag orders so they can request to combine/piggyback on existing orders if possible.
This is not a place to order swag.
Putting your information on this list will not cause swag to magically be mailed to you. Putting an entry on this list means that the coordinator listed is making the swag design/order/arrival/distribution process happen - you will still need to choose a design, find and pay a supplier, coordinate shipping, etc. This is an informative list for collaboration purposes.
Please list in chronological order.
