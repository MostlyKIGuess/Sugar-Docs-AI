Ulibarri has been involved in SugarLabs for about 4 years now. He fully commits to its mission to put education at the forefront of education technology and its commitment to empowering students with powerful tools for learning as well as the means, methods, and agency needed to maximize the learning potential.
Ulibarri has been a committed mentor for Google Summer-of-Code and Google Code-in for 4 years and just recently represented SugarLabs at the 2018 Google Summer-of-Code mentor summit.
