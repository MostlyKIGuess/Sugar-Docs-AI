Project management
A special workflow for Objectives resources, especially for doers. It shouldn't be as simple as possible since only Project developers see it.
For that case, Project can have several owners, maybe would be better to rename all these Players to Project Team, but in this case it is exactly about close group of Players who know each other well and work well on Project internals.
Project's Objectives have two faces, one simple for users and one for Project developers.

Should rating system be complex, (-2,-1,0,+1,+2) or simple just "Like".
Just "Like" (though, I guess, it should be named somehow different, maybe "Sweet!") sounds more appropriate solution for the Sugar Network, it is simple and still useful. --

How to calculate Player's reputation?
Counting the total amount of any contribution doesn't make much sense, e.g., people can spam in comments or a person who Release a Project version can't get the full benefit of this process (there are people who took part in preparing this release). Might be useful to count reputation only for contribution that was rated by people. --

Might be useful to have, at least in addition, Player's rating related only to the current Project, e.g., to appreciate Players (theirs replies) who are well known exactly within the current Project. --

Once an object have been selected by the player, he should be able to filter any type of contributions according to its ratings. --

Leaving responsibility to the viewer is a good tradeoff to avoid overcomplicated workflows but definitely it needs custom moderation, e.g., by teachers. --

Users Interface
Browser
Would be useful to add removable devices, e.g., USB sticks, to Zoom level selector. The reason is browsing Projects that are located on this removable device. For example it might be Sugar activities or Wiki Projects to activate them right from this removable device. --

Network Zoom
A basic conception that should allow the Sugar Network to better scale depending of Player's purpose. The Network Zoom levels are similar to The
Shell Zoom levels
(only the first three levels) and describe exactly the current
zooming
level of Sugar Network from an observer point of view. There are three Network Zoom levels:
Worldwide, the whole Network;
Neighborhood, accessible only if observer connected not to global server, e.g., to the one localed in school;
Private, observer himself.
The whole Contexts are associated with particular Zoom level, i.e., can be visible only on this particular level and all levels below. This level is also applied to all of the Context's resources.
Network Zoom levels only for projects might be, eg, not trivial to have Zoom levels for any kinds of resources, eg, every wiki page or every Gallery object at the same time, having levels only Projects might simplify the usage workflow as well. Friends level was removed since it will be hard to implement it technically, at least in current design. --

Might be not obvious when people work via the Internet. The clean separation can be done only for "Network vs. Private (objects on local user's machine)". --

Clouds
The one of problems in the field is a
lack
of storage space on students' XOs. The Sugar Network might be treated as a cloud to keep all/some Journal objects, that relate to particular Context, on the server side.
