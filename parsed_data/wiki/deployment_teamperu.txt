Summary
This page is an overview of a pilot program that will happen in 2012 in Peru. This effort is being led by Peru Local Lab. The detailed information (in Spanish) is
located
on the Peru Local Lab
home page
. This page also contains technical details of implementation that might be helpful for other deployments.
Layers
The whole picture is split into three layers: Schools, Deployment team, Upstream. The current section briefly characterize all of them.
Schools
The are two types of schools:
schools, one-teacher schools in villages:
laptop per child model;
about 10-20 students of different ages;
lack of technical support, only teachers;
no connectivity;
only XO laptops, no wireless access points, no dedicated hardware for school servers.
town schools (CRT):
computer labs, not laptop per child, model;
skilled technical personnel;
good connectivity;
good hardware equipment.

The problem
The problems with one-teacher schools are:
Lack of technical support, only teachers;
No connectivity;
Only XO laptops, no wireless access points, no dedicated hardware for school servers to provide additional content;
No translation to local languages.

Roles
All involved people might be categorized by the following roles.
XO students
Students from one-teacher multi-grade schools. They have XOs in personal usage.
XO teachers
Teachers from one-teacher multi-grade schools. They have XOs in personal usage as well. They are the only who maintain XO related workflows at schools on daily basis.
Chaski
Any person who can travel from one-teacher multi-grade schools to an internet access point and back.
Teachers Trainer
Lab students
Lab teachers
Network coordinators / Community Managers
Activate Network
Merge data
Moderate data
Monitor metrics
Connect downstream needs and upstream implementation
TODO more specific
Upstream
The rest of Sugar community.
TODO
concretize.
Infrastructure
Major components are:
SomosAzúcar Sugar Distribution: Hexoquinasa
,
Sugar Network
,
SomosAzúcar Teacher's Server
.
They are spread within the
Roles
as:
XO students
have:
XO image Hexoquinasa;
Sugar Network
frontend;
Statistics
monitor.
XO teachers'
s XOs operate as school servers and contain:
Additional storage on SD card;
School
Sugar Network
server;
A copy of
XO updates
repository;
(?)
Jabber server
;
(?)
Journal backups
;
(?)
Anti-thief
support.
Synchronization USB key
Sync data as a singular file that might be uploaded in any way,
the script to upload data,
Live image to boot to the hw and upload data.
Lab students
Trisquel image of Hexoquinasa;
Mothership
Center
Sugar Network
server;
XO updates
repository;
Workflows
These are kinds of workflows that
Roles
can take part in. The particular activity might involve several Players and several Roles.
Synchronization
A
Chaski
travels between a school that needs to be synchronized and a place with the connectivity.
The process is only about carrying the USB key, the rest should be done automatically.
TODO describe the process.
Training teachers
A process of teaching
XO Teachers
to use the system.
TODO describe the process.
Maintaining the Sugar Network
Network Coordinators
TODO describe the process.
Maintain
XO system updates
repository;
Sugar Network's workflows
The
workflows
that relate to Sugar Network.
