Title: BugSquad/Bug Triage
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/BugSquad/Bug_Triage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One key process in any software development project is the triaging of bugs and new features. The Sugar project has been part of the triage process used by the OLPC team (See
http://dev.laptop.org
). The tool,
trac
, seems more than up to the task. The challenge is to define unambiguous category tags in order to make the job of triage containable and to bring clarity to what is expected of developers.
Undoubted, a key is to define a clear
Roadmap
and decision-making process.
Please see the
discussion page
for ideas about how to improve the Triage process.
Currently, the OLPC trac system uses the following property categories and actions:
Type
defect
enhancement

Milestone
Update.1
Update.1.1
xs-03
Update.2
Gen-2
