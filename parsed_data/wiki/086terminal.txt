Terminal
Introduction
Terminal is an Activity that gives the Sugar user access to the GNU/Linux shell (similar to the Terminal program in Mac OS X or the Command Prompt in Microsoft Windows). It is an advanced activity for users who would like to explore the operating system at a deeper level and to access legacy and non-"Sugarized" applications. The Terminal activity is also used for occasional system maintenance.
More Info can be found on the
Activities/Terminal
page.
For information about how to use the GNU/Linux command-line, see
Gnu/Linux Command-line Manual
What is new for users
