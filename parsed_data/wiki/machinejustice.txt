Info
Freedom and Justice are two twin KVM hosts bought by Sugar Labs in 2012.
Justice is currently our primary VM hosting box, while freedom is a hot-standby running some secondary services in docker containers and backups.

Hardware
2U rack-mountable case
Motherboard Supermicro H8SGL (or maybe H8SGL-F)
8-core Opteron 6212 @ 1.7GHz
64GB RAM
2x1TB RAID1
Management
The two servers have SMT management cards from Supermicro with a seriously awful web interface:
justice-mng.sugarlabs.org
freedom-mng.sugarlas.org
Of course you need a separate account. Full KVM support requires the Java browser plugin (yuck!), so we mostly use them for the big reset button in case a server hangs (it happened about once per year).
Use a long, unguessable password, but not one you're also using elsewhere! A few years ago, a backdoor was discovered in this firmware which would reveal all passwords in plaintext with a simple telnet! Also, login uses unencrypted http.
It's also possible to talk to the management card from Linux using ipmitool.
Both cards are running firmware version 3.16, which patched a huge backdoor that would trivially reveal all passwords in plaintext. No kidding.  There's a
newer firmware version
, but attempts to update to it failed with both Chrome and Firefox (error: "413 - Request Entity Too Large"). I suspect a bug in their http POST implementationÂ :-(
