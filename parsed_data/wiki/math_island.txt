Overview
On Math Island, the user plays as a robot that has been stranded on an island. The robot has a limited amount of fuel, and there's a point on the island where it can escape. The player must navigate the robot past various obstacles to reach the end without running out of fuel. The robot's current fuel level and extra fuel tanks that the user can find are represented in fractions of a full fuel tank, and it costs a fraction of a fuel tank to move over terrain. Different types of terrain have different costs.
The goal of the game is to teach fractions at the level of a fourth grader, as defined by New York State. Players will need to calculate the cost of fuel to move across to a location, and calculate how much fuel they will gain by picking up a tank.
