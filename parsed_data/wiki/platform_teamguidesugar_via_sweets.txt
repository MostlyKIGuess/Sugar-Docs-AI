Getting involved
Installation
Fedora specific instructions:
sudo yum install gnome-packagekit
Important notes for XO users:
Some XO images might mount
/var/cache/yum
to the tmpfs. With this limited cache capacity, it will be mostly impossible to install anything of large size from the Fedora repositories. To work around this limitation, become a
root
user and enter the
umount /var/cache/yum
command in the Terminal activity or a console. To persist this change for subsequent boots, remove the corresponding line from the
/etc/fstab
file.
Debian, Ubuntu (starting from 11.10), Trisquel (starting from 5.5), Mint (starting from 12) specific instructions:
sudo apt-get install gnome-packagekit
Ubuntu (before 11.10), Trisquel (before 5.5), Mint (before 12) specific instructions:
sudo apt-get install packagekit-gnome
Then, in all environments:
wget
http://download.sugarlabs.org/sweets/sweets/installer.sh
sh installer.sh
After installing PackageKit, you need to restart the DBus system bus. The easiest way is to just restart the machine. If PackageKit was already installed, you need to relogin from X session at least.

What Sugar to launch
There are two types of Sugars that are accessible via Sweets:
sdk/sugar
, for pristine Sugar;
dextrose/sugar
, for Sugar based on
Dextrose
.
Both Sugars can be used in the same way. This guide uses
dextrose/sugar
.
Launch
To launch recent stable Sugar in emulator mode, type in Terminal activity or in any other terminal:
sweets dextrose/sugar:emulator
To make it possible to have additional dependencies involved, e.g., to run Browse activity, use
-S
command-line argument:
sweets -S dextrose/sugar:emulator
To run a particular, but not the latest, e.g., 0.88 version:
sweets dextrose/sugar:emulator = 0.88
To get information about what exact versions are provided, use
status command
with
-v
argument:
sweets status -v dextrose/sugar
Running sugar from X session
To start Sugar in the session mode, i.e., not from Xephyr, it will be useful to add a new X session. Place
sweets
invocation into your
~/.xsession
file:
PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
sweets sdk/sugar
and create a
/usr/share/xsessions/sweets.desktop
desktop file:
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Sweets
GenericName=Sweets
Exec=/etc/X11/Xsession
Type=Application
After getting a login screen, Sweets session should be present in the sessions list.
Upgrade
To upgrade Sweets itself, type in Terminal activity, or any other terminal:
sweets upgrade
To update information about new Sugar versions that come via Sweets, use
-R
command-line argument with any sweets launch variant, e.g., with
status
command:
sweets status -R dextrose/sugar
Supported distributions
The list of GNU/Linux distributions where Sugar sweets has been tested.
If there are problems with the following distributions or you need to run Sugar in another distribution,
let us know
. For new distributions, there are major requirements:
PackageKit needs to be supported;
Human help is needed to populate appropriate package names databases and for testing new sweets.
Debian
Wheezy
Polkit authentication doesn't work with
xdm
display manager, use
gdm3
, at least, instead.
Suggested dependencies, i.e.,
-S
sweets command argument, don't work for now.
Ubuntu
Oneiric (11.10)
Trisquel
