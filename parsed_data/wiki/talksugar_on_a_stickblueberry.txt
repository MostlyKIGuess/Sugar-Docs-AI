1. Download rt2870.bin from ralinktech.com (Be sure to download the Linux version).
2. Copy the .bin file into /lib/firmware
cp rt2870.bin /lib/firmware
3. You need to load the RPM Fusion repository for Fedora
sudo rpm -i
http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
or
sudo rpm -i

Note:
Step 4 is going to eat up lots of disk space.
Get help section is redundant to Sugar_help page
This help section should perhaps be moved to the general Sugar_help page, or be limited specifically to help with Sugar-on-a-Stick, and be cross-referenced to that page.  There's a lot of redundant information here.
Also, Is the answers portal still recommended for use?  The Sugar_help page doesn't link there or suggest its use.
