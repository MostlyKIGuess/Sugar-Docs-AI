Touch things to fix and keep an eye on
This is a rough brain dump of things to watch out for, will move this out onto other pages where appropriate:
Test UI at lower resolution
Portrait will be used more than it currently once we have touch only HW
Need to minimise toolbar overflows and improve touch experience when it does happen
Palette behaviours
Hover/right click
Clarify any primary button actions
Keyboard shortcut usage
Need any replacements using extra buttons/gestures?
Screen display backlight brightness/monochrome behaviour - probably best resolved with a brightness/display device icon & palette as per the volume device
Hiding keyboard accelerator hints when booting touch only hardware?
Right click
Touch and hold gesture
Prelight effects are usually for reinforcing UI interaction during a cursor movement/hover. For touch, should it be used to indicate a widget is being held down, or remove prelight effect?
Hover hints/tips
Double tap interaction
Make much more accommodating to second tap inaccuracy
Tune cursor touch point to just below top edge of contact point (based on screen rotation)
Maximise home view icon size layout
Widget size usability
Button spacing
Palette menu spacing
Size of hspan/vspan separator, gtk3 default looking a little better, GtkPaned
Check boxes to on/off slider GtkSwitch
8-10mm diameter hit targets
Up/down menu overflow scroll widgets too short
Remove primary action from Neighbourhood view AP/ad-hoc widgets
Double tap tuning to allow for errors in 2nd tap positioning
Canvas drag scrolling
XO 1.75 hard edge bezel?
Screen rotation much more common/frequent on tablet format HW
Landscape
Portrait
Better for long form reading/writing
Better use of space with on screen keyboard
Text selection touch features
Touch friendly handles for adjusting selection
Drag scrolling vs. text selection interaction
Double tap and drag to initiate selection?
Touch and hold, then drag to initiate selection?
New pop-up palette?
Cut/copy/paste
Speak
Share with friend (would require a clipboard clipping share enhancement)
