Code of Conduct
A motion by kaamtza was discussed but not seconded: "The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct to include the Geek Feminism Community anti-harassment Policy <
http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy
> and to dispose resources (if needed) for the complete text to be translated to Sugar supported languages. This Policy contemplates the existence of a RESPONSE TEAM and defining a way and procedure to contact them.
i18n for Aymara
Walter made a motion, seconded by kaametza: Approval for contracting Edgar [Quispe] to do $500 worth of translation in support of changes in Sugar and Sugar activities related to the 0.112 Release (approximately 500 words). Motion passed 4 in favor, 2 abstain, 1 absent.
Walter will investigate the scope of adding Sugarizer strings to the work statement.
Creation of a SLOB shadow mailing list
We discussed and generally agree to the merit of creating a separate list to track the SLOB discussions of various motions, but did not yet vote on a motion made by Walter, seconded by Samson: create a new public mailing list to host discussions of motions. (each new discussion will be preceded by a notification to the iaep list and when a decision is reached, a link to the discussion thread will also be published). Voting will continue by email. It was pointed out that in the past had a policy that that email voting had to include iaep@lists.sugarlabs.org to be a valid email vote.
A separate discussion ensued about what to name the list: two proposals: governance@ and project-management@ were the leading contenders.
GCI
We agreed that Walter and Ignacio would be program admins.
Discussion of "process" (and "guidelines") for requesting travel advances
We discussed and made no progress on this issue. The only guideline suggested to date is available funds.
SLOB election update
Samson reported that the election is underway and that to date 30 votes have been cast. It was agreed that Samson would send a reminder out to encourage votes to be cast by 15 October.
