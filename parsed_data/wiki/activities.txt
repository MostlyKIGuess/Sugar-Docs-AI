Learners
(Sugar users are
learners
.)
Learner applications in Sugar are called
Activities
.  They are software packages that automatically save your work—producing specific instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time. A specific Activity instance is a
Journal
event (see this discussion of
The Notion of "Keeping"
).  Many Activities support learner
collaboration
, where multiple learners may be invited to join a collective Activity session.
Feedback

Activity Team
's
Frequently Asked Questions
