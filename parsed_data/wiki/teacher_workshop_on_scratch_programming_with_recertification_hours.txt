Back to Scratch Day 2010
http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Scratch_Day_2010
APS teachers Dr. Ann Kennedy and Jeffrey Elkner are offering a
workshop on Saturday, May 22 (Scratch Day -
http://day.scratch.mit.edu
) on Scratch, a multimedia rich programming
and story telling environment for learning (
http://scratch.mit.edu
).
Dr. Kennedy and I have been using Scratch in our ELL classes for the
past two years, and I can say without hesitation that both our
students and their teachers like it a lot.  A group of "Scratchers"
and Scratch supporters is developing within APS parent groups that is
now offering after school Scratch classes at three elementary schools:
Taylor, Jamestown, and Arlington Science Focus.  The Career Center
offered well attended Scratch enrichment classes last Summer.
Using Scratch is a great way to integrate computer programming and
problem solving ideas with mathematics and language learning.  Since
it enables the creation of dynamic and interactive presentations, it
provides a much more powerful alternative to presentation software
such as PowerPoint.
Dr. Kennedy and I are excited about the opportunity to share what we
have learned about Scratch with our APS colleagues.  Please help us
spread the word.
Thanks!
