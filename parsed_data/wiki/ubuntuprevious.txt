<dfarning> satellit_e:  Dextrose on Trisquel, the new toast, should be coming out this week or later for those who prefer 100% freeÂ :)
From Lists: support-gang@laptop.org 07/15/2013

I just wanted to give everyone a heads about something coming down the pipe:)
On of the primary frustrations that I have been hearing from the
community is their inability to easily get hardware for their
deployments.
In response, we have released of an iso running Sugar on Ubuntu at
http://ubuntu.activitycentral.com/makeiso/iso/ubuntu_12.04-20130712_i686.iso
* Username is "ubuntu", with empty password.
As alway, AC's code is 100% free and open source.
What's new
* Tuned up python-dbus clears the last bug that made most activities
fail to start.
* Logs in into Sugar automatically.
* Most activities work (some will need some work, but it should not be
caused by problems in Sugar dependencies anymore, but things specific
to the activity). To be precise they start,  didn't test them in deeply
 Didn't test collaboration yet.
* General polish to make it look closer to a final product.
What fails
* Some quirks with the tamtam activities as usual, probably already
fixed in newer bundles.
* Write does not work as the gtk3 version of pyabiword or the gtk2
version of libabiword are not available in Ubuntu, so both gtk2 and
gtk3 versions of the activity are missing half of the dependencies.
* Etoys and Scratch fail, probably because squeak-vm is not the proper
version, so I'll be packaging that later as well.
* The keyboard and network sections of the CP fail, the code makes
some assumptions about being run in a xo or under fedora, resulting in
unhandled exceptions.
* Sometimes activities may fail to start if you open them right after
logging in, because something with dbus is not yet fully running.

How to install Sugar on Ubuntu 11.10
Ubuntu has updated Software Center and now only 0.88.1 sugar is offered. Tested  14:44, 4 March 2012 (EST)
--
User:Satellit
This is not reproducible.  Tested 6th March, ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso md5sum c396dd0f97bd122691bdb92d7e68fde5 on VirtualBox, with "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade" to install all updates.  Result was that Sugar versions 0.84, 0.86, 0.88, and 0.90 were all offered by Ubuntu Software Centre.  A user would naturally install 0.90 as the latest.
