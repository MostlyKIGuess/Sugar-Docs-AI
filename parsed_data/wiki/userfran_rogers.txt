Hello, I'm
Fran Rogers
, a fourth-year undergraduate in Computer Science at the
Rochester Institute of Technology
.
I'm taking the OLPC development seminar course at RIT this quarter (Winter '09), where we'll be
working with the Math 4 Team
. I've been involved in open source projects before (including
MediaWiki
), so I'm pretty excited to be a part of this project!
