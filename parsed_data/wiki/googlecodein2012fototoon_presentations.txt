--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Fototoon allow the user to work with all the boxes in the same screen, but should be good have a view to edit one box using the full screen. We need implement a way to display the comic created one box after another, maybe adding sound saved for every box. The presentation can be saved in a pdf, one box by page or exported as a video.
Task
Add full-screen mode to Fototoon
