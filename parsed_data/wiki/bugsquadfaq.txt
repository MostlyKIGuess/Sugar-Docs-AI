If I'm running Ubuntu, where do I report Sugar bugs?
If you are running official (or unofficial)
Sugar packages on Ubuntu
, and you encounter a bug in Sugar functionality or in an Activity which is bundled, please
report it in Ubuntu's Launchpad bugtracker
.
If you are running sugar-jhbuild, or the bug is in an activity which you downloaded as a .xo file, please report it in the
Sugar Labs bug tracker
.
