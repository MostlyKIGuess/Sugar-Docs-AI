See
Introduction to the Sugar Interface
for more information about Sugar and how it is used.
You will leave this Introduction if you click this link above ^.
To return here, click the
<== Back arrow
on your browser.
Boot Sugar
The
Home
view appears.
Click the
Neighborhood
view button
in the
Frame
or press the <F1> key to switch to the
Neighborhood
view.
You are represented by the XO avatar in the center of the screen.
Hover the pointer on it and the same pop-up palette menu will appear as in the
Home
view version of the avatar.
All the other XO avatars are other Learners on the network.
A Learner's name will be displayed when you hover over any avatar.
Sugar can make 3 types of network connections.
Ad hoc
- You should see 3 circles with different center symbols (representing
Maya numerals
):
A single dot - channel 1; a single dot with a bar - channel 6; a single dot with 2 bars - channel 11.
These are
Ad hoc
connections.
They allow Sugar to connect Learners in radio range of each other without an Internet connection.
Sugar is connected to Ad-hoc Network 1; a color-filled circle with a single dot surrounded by two wave fronts.
Wireless Access Points
- These may be present as color-filled circles (with or without a lock symbol).
These are the Wireless Access Points.
Wireless Access Points may not be present if there is no working wireless hardware in your computer or there are no Wireless Access Points in range of the computer.
You can click on any of these circles and Sugar will try to connect to the radio source.
A pop-up palette menu will appear with an option to
Connect
.
A secondary palette menu will let you set the encryption type
and ask for a password if the "
Wireless Access Point'
requires a password.
Click
(OK)
A successful connection will show wave fronts on each side of the
Wireless Access Point
circle you selected.
Wired network
- If you are plugged into an active wired connection
you will be automatically connected to the Internet when you boot Sugar.
There will be no indication of this connection from Network Manager software.
XO laptops  have no wired network connection hardware, so only wireless connections are possible using steps 1 or 2 above.
Press the
Home
view button and return to the
Home
view screen.
You are now connected to the Internet, if you succeeded in step 2 or 3 above.
Communicate in a Chat room
with other Sugar Learners and developers on IRC channels, such as #sugar and #sugar-es.
This requires an Internet connection.
Wireless Access Point
and
wired network
connections should show the Jabber XO avatars indicating a working connection to the Internet.
You must register with one of the working
Community Jabber servers
as
instructed here
.
