With thanks to
Read the Docs
SoaS Loader is available to preview on
http://soas-loader.readthedocs.org
Detailed Description
The method involves `livecd-iso-to-disk` as this
page
.
Construction is copied from Help Activity, which uses Sphinx,
http://sphinx-doc.org/
.
A
liveinst
method is under consideration.
Pro, makes nice 4 or 8 GB sticks.
Con, instructions are more difficult to write for novices.
If
the tutorial is to be available to all users, they should not easily be able to delete the host OS as could happen with anaconda.
Fairly detailed instructions are necessary to explain how to set up a
satisfactory for children
boot record.
Future versions
Might
include a script which would probe the capacity of an inserted USB stick,and deliver the livecd-iso-to-disk command on confirmation by the user.
Might
include liveinst instructions under the heading `How to install Sugar on an expired Windows XP machine`.
Benefit to Sugar
Allow new users to adopt Sugar more easily.
