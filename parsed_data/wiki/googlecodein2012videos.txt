Background
Video is a common way to provide How To documentation. Sugar Labs has a Dailymotion page
[1]
with a handful of videos and other videos
here
but the quality is iffy and the coverage is very thin.
Task
Create How-to videos for Sugar and Sugar activities. Either through Screenshots or Screen capturing. Would be very helpful if text boxes could be modular and set up for translation to the many languages Sugar is available. Having a reusable template to accomplish How-to videos would be a great tool for the community.
