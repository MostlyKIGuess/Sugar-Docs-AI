Design sketch
Sketch showing proposed features for an intermediate Activity start view
Activity start UI flow
Flow from Home view through to the Activity. Are all Home Activity icons now in a monochrome state, or perhaps in the user colours (the New option should then be in the user colours as well). Note the pulser animation is now on a black background to be more seamless with the Start UI
Requirements
Must appear quickly for immediate feedback of Activity icon click/touch. No more than 1000ms, ideally some visual update should happen before 100ms (e.g. white blanking before we currently see the activity pulsing icon draw). Some UI content, such as image thumbnails, can be delayed as long as the rest of the UI & intermediate thumb placeholders are there.
Must allow closing/stopping/cancelling so the user can back out quickly if they change their mind
Should cope with the user using the Frame or alt-tab to switch elsewhere without completing the dialogue, and possibly returning later
Starting a new activity
Clicking/touching an Activity .xo bundle in Journal
Clicking/touching an Activity icon in Home Favourite, or Home Activity List view, and clicking/touching "Start new" from the proposed Activity new/resume intermediate UI
Resuming an activity
Clicking/touching an activity instance icon in the Journal
Clicking/touching an Activity icon in Home Favourite, or Home Activity List view, and clicking/touching an activity instance from the proposed Activity new/resume intermediate UI
Clicking/touching a shared Activity icon in the Neighbourhood or Group view
Switching to an active activity
Clicking/touching an Activity icon in the Frames top edge
Clicking an activity instance icon in the Journal that is already active
Clicking/touching an active shared Activity icon in the Neighbourhood or Group view
Clicking/touching an Activity icon in Home Favourite, or Home Activity List view, and clicking/touching an already active activity instance from the proposed Activity new/resume intermediate UI
Stop activity
Stopping an activity should return to the Home View.
Manage Activities
Home List View should continue to be used to manage Activities (favourite, un-favourite, erase). Installing an Activity is still done via the Journal (e.g. clicking on a .xo bundle, or downloading one from a Friend or via Browse).
