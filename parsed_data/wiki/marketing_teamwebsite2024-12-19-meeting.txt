Improvements to website structure
Overall, the website should answer visitors' questions, guiding them to answers in the most logical and natural way possible.
Music Blocks page
We should add testimonials to this page.
Leadership page
We should add Devin as the executive director to the page (picture and bio).
At the end of the year, we'll need to update the board of directors as we will have new members to the board.
What to do about Sugar Stories page?
Context: We have a Sugar Stories page on
https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-stories/
, but we also have Sugar Stories being published on our Medium page. What should we do? Should we publish to both? Should we point to the Medium page from our page?
Discussion: Hey so again I found a similarity, our organization ecell, we had a similar thing and we decide to upload on website along with medium, so if we are uploading on website we need an indexing page like medium. Ref:
https://ecell.iiit.ac.in/articles/
We use the same jekyll site here as well. I could work on that page!
Next meeting
21:00 IST / 10:30 EST /15:30 UTC on December 26, 2024
