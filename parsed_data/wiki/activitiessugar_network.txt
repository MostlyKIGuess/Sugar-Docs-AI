Summary
Sugar activity to distribute
Sugar Network
clients and demonstrate Sugar Network functionality.
Sugar activity way to use Sugar Network has limitations:
Install
dependencies
manually;
No activity launcher windows;
No fast way to switch to Sugar Network window, it is regular Sugar activity.
But it provides easy way to try Sugar Network from regular Sugar installations. To use Sugar Network on regular basis, look for other
options
.

Usage
Contributor Hub, one of bundled Sugar Network clients, is coded using
