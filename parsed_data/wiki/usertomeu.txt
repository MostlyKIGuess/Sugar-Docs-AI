Short bio
Tomeu Vizoso is currently (May 2010) maintaining some
Sugar
modules and coordinating the development team.
Collabora Ltd.
is sponsoring his work in Sugar, including revamping of the
Telepathy
-based collaboration framework. Got involved in Sugar development first as an
One Laptop Per Child
(OLPC) volunteer, then under a contract with that organization for almost two years.
Born in 1978 in Palma de Mallorca (Spain), studied computer science in the
Universitat de les Illes Balears
(achieving bachelor's degree in 2001) and in the
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya
(achieving master's degree in 2006).
His first 6 years of professional experience were spent in web applications and database design and implementation, with emphasis on big distributed systems and systems optimization. In 2006 finished his master's degree and gained skills in the development of desktop-oriented applications and
Open Source
contribution, leading this to his involvement in the Sugar project.
