The Crikey activity - available at
http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4493
- is a modified version of Sugar's default Measure activity.
The most significant changes are:
Activity starts in sensor-reading mode
Input is slowed down to 100th the speed, so you can view changes to a sensor's input over a few seconds, instead of a fraction of a second. (A sensor reader, not an oscilloscope)
Input is scaled to fit inside the graph window
Input is inverted so that temperature and light sensors' input is more intuitive (higher values on the graph from greater temperature and light)
You can record and/or set an audio alarm for when the sensor's value reaches the maximum or minimum
