Website feedback as it relates to fundraising
GSoC and DMP report
Lionel reports that 3D Volume activity is being merged. Sugarizer Vue.js is still being worked on.
The RPi team has put together a nice version of Sugar to make it easier to use (and access sensors specific to RPi) and solid documentation.
The MB team: Lesson Plan generator exceeded my expectations; Midi and ABC support extend the reach of MB; collaboration is about to land (as soon as the server is stablized).
Maths Games: some nice new activities (Check out Bunny Island).
Martin is pleased with the quality of the FlatPak projects.
AI on AWS
Devin secured the AWS grant.
Ibiam is helping to migrate serevers to the platform (Pippy and Chat as the first pass.)
Micro-internships for October
The nonprofit Code Day just does it to host interns as an education project, which aligns with us very well. Devin met with the ED at FOSSY, who presented on their nonprofit and internships.

Website feedback as it relates to fundraising
We've received feedback about our websites and how it impacts our ability to fund raise, as well as what we've been recommended to do to remedy the situation.
Devin put the feedback, as well as a bit of an analysis here:

Devin has been moving his focus even more to general (non-grant) fundraising; two separate people suggested that our websites are a big barrier to getting donations.
Ideas:
remove all dead links
propose pathways for each user time
mock up (Figma?) these pathways
discuss implementation/maintenance implications
Also:
New landing page for the wiki that focuses on the content we care about/maintain
Cull the sidebar
PyCon Africa
Samson is speaking at Pycon Africa tomorrow (2024-09-26), about Code + Community. His goal is to do CTA to recruit Python devs to Sugar Labs.
