4th Grade Math Topics
Background
I'm a first year photojournalism major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I've had only a little bit of programming experience (VB class), but I want to learn more. I've also messed around with creating websites. In working with the Math4Team, I'm hoping to learn Python and how to use it with making games.
In addition, I will be documenting class activities photographically.
