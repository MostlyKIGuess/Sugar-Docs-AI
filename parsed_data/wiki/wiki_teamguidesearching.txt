You can easily find whatever you might be looking for using the
search box
in the
sidebar
at the left of every page.
There are two search buttons, labeled
Go
and
Search
, and they give you slightly different results.

Go Button
When you use the
Go
button you will be taken directly to an article of the name you entered in the search box.
The
Go
button is case-
sensitive
.
If an article of that name does not exist, you will be given a link which lets you create it.
and
you will automatically get a search for that text, as if you had pressed the
Search
button.
Search Button
Pressing the
Search
button will search through the wiki in two different ways.
It's not like Google!
.
First you get a listing of matches to article
titles
.
Then you get a listing of matches to
text in the body
of articles.
The
Search
button is case-
insensitive
Hints
The
Search
button will always give you a search.
The
Go
button gives you a search only if an article of that exact name does not exist, and in that case you'll also get a link which lets you create the article.
If you press the
Return
key on your keyboard it's the same as pressing the
Go
button with the mouse, not the
Search
button.
