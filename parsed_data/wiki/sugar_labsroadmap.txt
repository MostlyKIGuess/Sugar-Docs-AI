Introduction
A Roadmap is a plan made up of phases.
With the evolution of Sugar Labs comes the need to reflect and plan the future. See this
call to task
.
Some Sugar Labs members like to quote Alan Kay, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."  Sugar Labs has emulated some of the best practices of the most successful free and open source software projects. We should continue to refine those principles. Sugar and Sugar Labs is also more than free and open source software. Many people are enamored with the project because it envisions a new generation of learners with powerful new tools.  Sugar Labs depends on volunteers—people who want to invent the future—who love to engage in authentic activities—activities that help fulfill the potentials they individually see in Sugar's vision.  Such contributors formulate personal roadmaps to build out a vision they are most passionate about. Then, following our
principles
and
pedagogy
, they collaborate and
discover
new
ideas
and methods for fulfilling a vision.
Team roadmaps
develop and get fulfilled.  They also reflect on what they've learned and take time to refine their plans.
Please help us redefine our roadmap.
Phase I
Focus on Mission, Vision, and Values.  This is a pretty high-level discussion which builds on top of similar work we did last year.  The emphasis will be 'what we share in common.'

And this
post on Vision and Mission
.
We will continue to refine our mission, vision, and values.  They represent our public.

Phase II
How we get there?
Building capacity - Building product
See this
discussion thread
on building engineering capacity.
Innovation - Implementation
Supply side - Demand side
Education - Technology
Internal - External
The emphasis will be on what trade offs and compromises are required given our current and near term resources and how do we leverage our strengths while minimize our weaknesses.
Phase III
Iterative process between:
Personal Roadmaps
Team Roadmaps
Project Roadmaps
The emphasis will be on setting personal, team, and project level goals to make Phase I happen while considering the constraints identified in phase II.
