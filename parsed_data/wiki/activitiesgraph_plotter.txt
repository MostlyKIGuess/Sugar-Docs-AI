Story
The starter idea was from Ana Cichero, a maths teacher from Uruguay. Here students can't pay an expensive calculator, but their little siblings have XO computers and she needed an activity easy to use where her students can do their homework or revise previous than their tests. Now there are advanced students with XO computers and this activity is very useful for them.
