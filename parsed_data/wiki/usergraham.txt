Graham
Location: Nova Scotia, Canada
Interests: I have a lot of experience in user experience, online content and product development. I am an advocate and champion of open source software and knowledge, and believe that I, and you, can make software that is usable by many and easily accessible with an internet connection.
I have realized that I learn the most and get the most fulfillment from collaborating with others, and think Sugar is a platform worth investing time and energy into for both
children and adults alike
in developing and developed countries around the world
I also think we can help other countries make better decisions about technology and energy consumption by building tools and access to knowledge.
