Sucrose 0.85.7 Release Notes
Announcement
This is really the last development release in the 0.86 release cycle - see the
0.86/Roadmap#Schedule
for more details. Note, that we
slipped the final 0.86 release by one week
.
Please test the landed
features
carefully. More information about what is new in this release can be found in the
0.86/Notes
- please mind that this is ongoing work. Please report any bug and workflow issue you find to get them in good shape for the final release. A friendly
BugSquad
will be available to triage those bugs accordingly and the developers can never have enough bug food. If you have non-bug feedback about features you can use the sugar-devel mailing list to share it with us.
Compatibility
There are no known compatibility issues, as of today.
Update to this version
Please use the instructions for your distribution (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian etc) of choice to upgrade to this release.
