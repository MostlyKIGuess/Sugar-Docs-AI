Sucrose Development
Sucrose 0.89.x is an unstable development series intended for testing and
development purposes. Sucrose uses odd minor version numbers to indicate
development status, so this unstable 0.89.x series will finally become
the 0.90 stable release.
Schedule
The Sugar 0.89.x schedule is based on the
GNOME 2.31.x development cycle
. One reason is that Sugar as based on the GNOME stack. Another reason is that GNOME makes sure that their release will be able to be shipped by the major distributions.
Tarball Monday:
The tarballs for the modules are always due on Mondays.
Release Wednesday:
The releases during the cycle will happen on Wednesdays.
Current freezes in place for the 0.89 development release.
