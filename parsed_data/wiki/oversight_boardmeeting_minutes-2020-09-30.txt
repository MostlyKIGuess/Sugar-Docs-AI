James and Ibiam Sugar Activity Job Report
SLOBs discussed the activities they would like to work on:
Alex would like to see IRC Activity ported.
(mostly agreed, but some considerations for how to connect)
"Amazonas Torgua" (Turtle for Peru) -- subclass instead of a fork???
Numbers (and other activities) are essentially the same code. (Hewitt)
Labyrinth (mind-mapping tool) is nice, but maybe it should be rewritten from scratch.
GetBooks -- Hooked into Project Gutenberg.
Popular ones that need work:
Math Quwy
Hangman (maybe refactor for pedals falling off a flower)
Make them fall
Sonic Jump
Jamedia Tubes -- "Chosen b/c we need a media player for sugar..."
Etoys -- "I think this activity should be brought back to sugar"
I can read
Needs testing
Implode
Nutrition
[...]
Start on GetBooks first.
