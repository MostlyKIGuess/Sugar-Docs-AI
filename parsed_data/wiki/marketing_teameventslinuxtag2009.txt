Sugar Activities
Sugar does advocate the concepts of activities - you learn through doing, so if you want more learning you want more doing. So the Sugar Labs team wants to get engaged at Linuxtag:
We will have a
booth
located at 7.2a 110a.
Greg gives the talk:
"Education, Innovation, and Free Software"
(Saturday, 27.06 - 15.00-16.00 Saal 5)
Simon gives the talk:
Sugar - a software playground for learning about learning"
(Saturday, 27.06 - 17.00 Saal 5)
Sebastian will be giving a barcamp session at
FUDCon
about various educational efforts, mainly SoaS (
Linuxtag Fudcon project
)
Pablo Casal and Eduardo Blanco from Netlabs are giving the talk:
"Plan Ceibal - A country-wide OLPC deployment in Uruguay"
(Saturday 27.06 - 16.00 Saal 5). They designed the initial proposal for Ceibal's network, and are currently consultants for the project.
Sugar Booth
Our booth will be at 7.2a 110a. We share this
booth
with our friends from:
OLPC Deutschland e.V.
Squeak Germany
Skolelinux Germany
Linux4Afrika
X2go
Please list your availability if you are interested in helping with the booth. Or if you already know which shifts you want to take, feel free to add yourself in the second table. German skills are welcome - but not needed. Ideally a shift is two people, but given the space reserved at the booth size I think we can get away with one as well. Helping at the booth means answering questions regarding Sugar and Sugar Labs, demoing Sugar and flashing Soas on request. People helping at the booth will get a Linuxtag ticket.

all times are local Berlin times
Storage Space
We have a coops (Germans would say Kab√ºffchen as a diminutive of Kabuff) at the booths. As this is only meant for booth equipment all the other belongings like jackets, luggage etc can be stored at the wardrobe without any cost.
Power and Internet Connectivity
Power and Internet will be provided by LinuxTag and Messe Berlin for the project booths. What we need are:
extension cords
long network cables
Not permitted by Linuxtag:
wireless access points (You are not permitted to operate your private wireless LAN. Please take this serious. There will be several site surveys to ensure this.) - Mesh networking is allowed though
coffeemakers, kettles and cooking stuff
connect visitors to the project's network
Lunch
Linuxtag is offering Lunch for the helpers. If we want to participate we would need helpers and not only eaters. More information can be found
at
.
Flyer

TODO
Flyers with information about: Sugar, Sugar Labs, The times for the Sugar talks at Linuxtag
Poster - From the Linuxtag Team: Please prepare at least one large poster (A1 or A0) to be placed on the walls of your booth or infocounter, so that visitors understand what the booth is all about, or what the particular machine in front of them intends to demonstrate. Without posters or other similar stuff the booth will probably look a bit deserted and not that interesting at all. -- You can use adhesive tape to fix the posters on the walls. If you plan to demonstrate fancy hardware at your booth, it is very helpful to describe these particular pieces of hardware in a poster or a large sign, so that visitors recognize its value or notice that it is extraordinary.
Project Workshops / BoFs: Linuxtag still have quite some slots left for workshops. The ultimate deadline for asking for a space for a workshop will be reached on Sunday, June 21st, 2009.
