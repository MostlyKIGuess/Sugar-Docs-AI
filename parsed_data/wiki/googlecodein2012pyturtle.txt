--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Sugar provides a number of visual programming environments for children, including Etoys, Turtle Art, and Scratch. Turtle Art, which is based on the Logo language, can export projects as Logo. There is a partially Sugarized version of UCB Logo, but it is not well integrated. There is a Python Logo project,
[1]
, which has the potential of more fine-grained integration into Sugar, however it is based on KDE.
Task
Port PythonTurtle to GTK3 and then Sugarize it.
