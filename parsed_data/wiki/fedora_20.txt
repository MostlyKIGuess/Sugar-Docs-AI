COPR Backported GNOME 3.12 packages for Fedora 20 repo
"Backported Backported GNOME 3.12 packages for Fedora 20 packages for Fedora 20"
Experimental use with caution ?
installing sugar-desktop from another DE (ie gnome3 or KDE) as a second Desktop Environment
In Root Terminal:
yum install @sugar-desktop sugar-runner xorg-x11-server-Xephyr
sugar-runner is the replacement for sugar-emulator.
It allows sugar to run full screen from another DE (ie gnome3 or KDE) menu as: Education/sugar
Tested in LXDE; Mate; Cinnamon, Gnome3 and KDE and works well from Education/Sugar in their menus.

know how to force a reinstall of a kernel
yum reinstall kernel isn't doing anything
you need to re-run the scriptlets
this is not done with "yum reinstall"
"rpm -q --scripts kernel-version-release" would tell you what to rerun

Upgrading Fedora using yum
Upgrading f20 installs with yum to f21
Dennis Gilmore 09/24/2024  IRC
"I have updated a few machines by running "yum --releasever=21 install
fedora-release" then "yum distro-sync" and not had any issues. As I
understand this thread it is soley about what to do in the case of
using fedup only. in which case we need to setup some things in
mirrormanager and do some testing and see what happens. note that we
may not be able to use the fedora-install-21 prefix as the install
trees all have a prefix already assigned"

Dracut Options
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Dracut/Options#Network
"The root filesystem used by the kernel is specified in the boot configuration file, as always.
The traditional root=/dev/hda1 style device specification is allowed.
If a label is used, as in root=LABEL=rootPart the initrd will search all available devices for an ext2 or ext3 filesystem with the appropriate label,
and mount that device as the root filesystem. root=UUID=uuidnumber will mount the partition with that UUID as the root filesystem."

Gnome Initial Setup
Screenshots  of gnome3 initial setup with explanatory text
Be sure to enter both root and user in anaconda
Gnome-initial-setup requires a stornger password than anaconda does.
This is important if you plan to use multiple Desktop Environments (DE) you will end up with 2 Users once you run the 2nd DE. ie gnome3 and KDE
If you do not setup the user name and password in anaconda G-I-S will run in anaconda and repeat I-S  when you boot the second DE
Bug in G-I-S and I-S (Initial-setup)
