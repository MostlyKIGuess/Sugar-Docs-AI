Overview
HelloMesh is a demonstration of D-Bus Tubes functionality for activity collaboration. As an activity it does nothing other than be sharable. It is intended to have sample code for Tubes operations. See Collaboration Tutorial for an explanation of what it does.
HelloMesh was originally produced from the Connect activity code which functioned as a testbed for Tubes implementation.
