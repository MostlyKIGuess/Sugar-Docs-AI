Sugar to distro packages :)
The main purpose of this project is helping people to package Sugar for various non-mainstream GNU/Linux distributions.
If a GNU/Linux distribution is not Debian/Fedora/Ubuntu based and there is a lack of human resources to maintain packages, this project could be valuable.
How it works
The general idea is to collect all distro-independent information in one place to minimize maintenance costs.
The process for generating packages is:
Fetch dependencies from
sugar-jhbuild
(native sugar building system)
Add distro-independent content like common package dependencies, various strings, urls etc.
Use distro-specific templates to generate native packages
Supported distros
Currently supported followed distributions:
Gentoo
ALT Linux
Mandriva
Magalhães
openSUSE
Ubuntu
