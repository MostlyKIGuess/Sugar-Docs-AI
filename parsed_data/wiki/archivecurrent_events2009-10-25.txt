2. Last week, Sayamindu Dasgupta posted a
blog
about the various tools for downloading and reading books in Sugar. If you haven't yet seen it, it is worth a look.
3. In response to the discussions about the need for more amd more accessible lesson plans, Martin Dengler has wiki-fy
your Sugar Lesson Plan template
.

7. Rubén Rodríguez Pérez had a correction to the information I posted last week re the Trisquel packaging of Sugar. Please refer to

8. I have been trying to wrap my head around how to use Cairo in Sugar. With the help of Tomeu Vizoso, I finally think I understand how it all works. Check out
Activity Team/Sample code/Ruler
. I modified Mitchell Charity's Ruler to use the new toolbars and enable one to set the DPI of the display. (Ruler had previously been set to display correctly on the OLPC XO; as a consequence, the DPI was wrong on most other displays.) Next, I'll try to re-factor Turtle Art to use Cairo.
