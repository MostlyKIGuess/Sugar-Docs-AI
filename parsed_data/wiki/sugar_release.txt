NOTE to EDITORS:
The (lumped) code above has that shape so that 'span' directives control the CR & LF (which otherwise would interfere with the layout if it was formatted). Edit carefully. Sorry for the lump.

Usage
Don't hardcode build and release information in pages.
Unless a page is obviously historical (e.g. "April 2007 test results") never say "the current release is 708".
Instead, invoke this template to present latest release information.
{{ Latest Releases }}
If you just want to display a particular latest build within a paragraph, you can invoke one of the sub-templates:
The current release candidate is {{Latest Releases/rc}}
Samples
Template:Latest Releases
{{ Latest Releases }}
The current release candidate is {{Latest Releases/rc}}
produces
The current release candidate is
