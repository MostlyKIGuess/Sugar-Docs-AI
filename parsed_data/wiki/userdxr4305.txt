PacMath
- PacMath is an educational game based off the well known 80's arcade game PacMan. Using the original game concept PacMath will add fourth grade level math to the fun and exciting game of PacMan in order to make learning fun. The game will provide the student with different problems and in order to solve the problem correctly the student will have to eat the ghost with the correct answer.
