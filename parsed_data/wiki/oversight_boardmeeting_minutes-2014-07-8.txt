Sugar 102 Release
Youth Summit
Sugar 102 Release
We discusses [0.102/Notes|Sugar 102] and the issue that despite having made great progress, we are lagging in uptake of the new Sugar. We agreed to (1) prepare a prospectus on the new build both from the technical and pedagogical POVs and (2) approach Sugar deployments directly with a pitch to upgrade.
Youth Summit
We agreed on a .UY venue in September 2014. Jose Miguel and Daniel will get back to us about specifics.
