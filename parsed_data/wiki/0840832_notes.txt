Sucrose 0.83.2 Release Notes
Announcement
This is our second Development Release in the 0.84
cycle
. Besides all the great bug fixing that has been going into this release we want to highlight some interesting changes.
Some great work has been going into this release regarding the 'View source' support. The source of all the activities can be shown, and browse does still support showing the source of the document.
Sugar now supports setting up a priority list of languages. Not all programs have translations for all languages. You can create a list of languages in the Control panel that are used to display messages in place of a non-existent translation.
More work has been going into the sugar support for NM 0.7. We finished the support for wireless devices in the frame, updated the radio off code in the control panel to work with NM 0.7 and added WPA support.
Three great activities are now part of fructose, the Image Viewer activity, Turtleart and Jukebox. They have been included in sugar-jhbuild. Give them a try!
Compatibility
When you upgrade a computer running an earlier version,
The old datastore will be updated to the new format.
Your old profile (in
.sugar/default/config
) will be imported into GConf
If you later downgrade from Sucrose 0.83.x to an earlier version,
The datastore is incompatible
You will be prompted to enter all your profile settings like you are on first boot
Most of the activities in Sucrose 0.83.x should be compatible with Sucrose 0.82 , the version shipped with OLPC Release 8.2.0.  An exception is Browse, which depends on new versions of XULRunner and Hulahop.  Read likewise may soon depend on a new version of Evince
