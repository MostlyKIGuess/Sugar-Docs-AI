Past Meetings
13 April 2009
13:42 dfarning: I think the two priorities are translation and meetings. 
13:42 FGrose dfarning: For meetings, do you mean Calendar use, or note taking and other things as well?
13:47 dfarning I am think about streamline the whole meeting process from agenda template, to sending list notices, to make it
      easy to  add and use the calanders to posting notes to the wiki and following up with a this-is-what-happened email.
13:48 dfarning My feeling is that as a result of the SoaS success we are going to get a nice bump in new contributors over
      the next few months.

The biggest issue was lack of ownership and maintenance of the teams wiki space.  We decided that every activate team should have a clear owner.  We will mothball inactive teams until we can find a team leader to take responsiblity.
Accessibilty Team -> mothball
BuildTeam -> roll into Development
Deployment Team -> dirakx
Design Team -> Eben
Development Team -> Marco
Documentation Team -> david
Education Team -> Walter
Infrastructure Team -> Bernie
Localization Team -> mothball
Marketing Team -> Gregdek
Oversight Board -> Walter
Development Team/Release -> mothball
Wiki Team/Translation -> mothball
BugSquad -> Simon with help
Wiki Team -> david
(Does anyone else see the irony of the dyslexic guy owning both documentation and wiki?)
Each team will create a mission statement and set a regular meeting time.
There was discussion about the missions and roles of the Education Team and the Deployment Team.  The general consensus was the EducationTeam will focus on 'Why' use Sugar. The Deployment team will focus on 'How' to use Sugar.
