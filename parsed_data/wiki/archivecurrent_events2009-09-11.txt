Sugar Digest
1. The car allowance rebate system (CARS), more commonly known as the “Cash for Clunkers” program, was used to bail out the US auto industry. People who had purchased gas guzzlers were rewarded with $4500 towards the purchase of a more fuel-efficient car.  Of course there was no subsidy for those of us who commute by bicycle—I could use some new panniers.
Maybe it is time to bail out the US education industry. When will the US government announce the "Sugar for Clunkers" program? It would work a bit differently than the car program in that with Sugar, there is no need to subsidize the purchase of replacement hardware—we'll have to find another program to bail out the computer industry. Simply replace the clunker software that most schools are using—Windows 2000 or Windows XP—with Sugar.  Sugar is, of course, free—as in speech and as in beer. Any government subsidy could go towards teacher workshops. “Yes we can!”
2. I had the opportunity to present Sugar to HRH Princess Ubolratana Mahidol at an MIT Symposium, “Miracle of Life”, which focused on her youth development program in Thailand. John (J5) Palmieri and I demoed Sugar on a Stick to the princess (See
photos from the event
). We had an animated discussion and I will be following up with Khun Paron, a leading pedagogist in Thailand regarding next steps.
