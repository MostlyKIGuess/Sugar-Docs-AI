Flip
A simple strategy game where you flip "coins" in order to get all of them with the same side up.
How to play
Click on a dot and it will reverse its state (color) and that of its immediate neighbors to the north, south, east, and west. You win when all of the dots are of the same state (color).
Did you know
that each time you win, the grid gets larger?
Did you know
that you can play over the network with your friends?
Programming Challenge
Add images of coins (heads and tails) instead of the colored dots.
