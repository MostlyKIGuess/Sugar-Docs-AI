About Me
My name is Taylor Plimpton I am in the Game Design and Development program at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  I am currently enrolled in the 3rd iteration of the One Laptop per Child class offered at RIT.  My original idea located here:
My Math4 Game Idea
, I have set aside due to another teammate, but I'm happy with the fact that I have joined the
PacMath
team.  If I wasn't so new to Python I would have loved to tackle my idea alone, which I am thinking about doing after this quarter's experience.
