Sugar on Windows
No one has ported Sugar to
Microsoft Windows
(that we know of), but you can run Sugar on GNU/Linux in an emulator on top of a Windows operating system.
Note:
Alternatively, you can boot your computer with a Sugar Live CD or Live USB—this will enable you to run Sugar without making any modifications to your Windows installation. See
Sugar on a Stick/Boot
.
Note:
The Wine Activity lets you run many Windows-based applications from within Sugar.
A Sugar installer for Windows
Wade Brainerd wrote a simple Sugar installer for Windows:
OLPC-XO-Software-8.2.0-Setup.exe
07-Nov-2008
It installs/uninstalls a working Sugar environment (based on Ton van Overbeek's QEMU—See below) with just a few clicks.  (Unfortunately, it does not install any Activities to use in that environment.)
The installer was built using the open source installer creator NSIS (nsis.sourceforge.net). The installer script can be found here:
wininstall/.git
Note to build administrators:
NSIS exists for GNU/Linux, so this process of creating Windows-based installers for Sugar could be automated.
