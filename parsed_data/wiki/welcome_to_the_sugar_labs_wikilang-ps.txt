Sugar reinvents how computers can be used for education.
It promotes sharing and collaborative learning and gives children the opportunity to use their laptops on their own terms. Children — and their teachers — have the freedom to reshape, reinvent, and reapply their software, and content. Sugar is based on GNU/Linux, a free and open-source operating system.
د شوګر اسانتياوې، شريكونه....
ماشومان كولاى شي، چې يو څۀ وليكي او يا په ګډه سره ټنګ ټكور كمپوز كړي.
هېڅ دوتنه، لاسوند او يا اپلېكېشن نشته.
كوم كار چې تاسې كوئ يواځې يو
فعاليت
دى، او دا فعاليت د اپلېكېشنونه او ستا ټوله ډېټا او مالومات تشكيلوي.
دا خبرنه تقريبا د نه منلو ده، چې تاسې خپله ډېټا له لاسه وركړئ.
هرڅۀ خوندي دي، او په خپلكاري توګه بياترلاسه كېداى شي.
ډېټا ته د لاسرسي لپاره تاسې ورځپاڼه كاروئ.
It's like a diary of stuff that you made.
دا وړيا او پرانيستې-سرچينو ساوتري دي.
There are no strings attached and updates will
always
respect users' freedom.

Sugar is available under the free software GNU General Public License (GPL) to anyone who wants to extend it. “Sugar Labs”, a (soon to be established) non-profit foundation will serve as a support base and gathering place for the community of educators and software developers who want to extend the platform and create Sugar-compatible applications. Sugar Labs software is found on the XO laptop. You can find more out about the project at laptop.org.
