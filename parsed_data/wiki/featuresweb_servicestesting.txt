--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the frustrations with our previous collaboration framework was how hard it was to test it. We want to get as much testing as possible with collaboration through web services.
These are the different things we'd like to cover:
testing discovering and setting up online accounts: for this we'll provide a dummy social service (i.e.: SugarLabs sharing). This'll allow us to exercise different parts of the web services codebase: is the service discovered? can you configure it? can you post something? can you refresh? (TBD: Walter/Raul)
testing each individual component. For each added service we'd like a minimum set of tests that will allow us to do a quick run from the command line and test that the service just works. That'll save loads of time when actual testing integration with Sugar.
more stuff to come.
