The Effectiveness of a FLOSS-like Learning Community in Formal Educational Settings (PDF)
"The objectives of this 2nd report of the FLOSSCom project are as follows: To analyze and evaluate the differences between Free / Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities as informal learning environments and on the other side formal educational settings. Point out ways on transferring those FLOSS principles to formal educational settings. Look at existing examples of eLearning delivery and examine why these do not provide the types of constructivist learning environments observed in FLOSS communities. Provide examples of formal educational environments similar to FLOSS communities that would be further addressed at the FLOSSCom Phase 3 FLOSS-like education transfer report."
