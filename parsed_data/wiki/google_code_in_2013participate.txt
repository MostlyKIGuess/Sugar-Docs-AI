Title: Google Code In 2013/Participate
URL: https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Google_Code_In_2013/Participate#Students
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Google Code-in (GCI) is a contest for pre-university students (e.g., high school and secondary school students) with the goal of encouraging young people to participate in open source. We work with open source organizations, each of whom will provide a list of tasks to be completed by student contestants. Tasks can be anything an organization needs help with, from bug fixes, to writing code, to user experience research, to writing documentation. The contest takes place entirely online.
Google Code-in is intended to help students who may have wanted to get involved in open source but didn't know where to start. By working through the tasks created by participating open source organizations, contestants will be given the opportunity to engage with the open source community and get involved. The participating open source organizations gain the benefit of additional contributions to their project, often in important areas that may get overlooked for whatever reason. It is Google's not so secret hope that the student contestants of today will be long-term contributors to these and other open source projects in the future.
