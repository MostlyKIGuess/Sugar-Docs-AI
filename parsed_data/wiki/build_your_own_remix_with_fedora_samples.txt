Thanks for all your help.
I managed to get it to work with the --nochroot option.
Hope to have some results to show soon.
I am trying to create an XFCE-based remix, but with all the extra goodies like in Fusion/Kororaa, etc.
Cheers

It is a bit tricky, you need to do it outside of root environment,
hence do this in "--nochroot" part of kickstart file, but you need to
know which temp directory is used for root.
You can check out my kickstart file for inspiration:
https://github.com/valentt/Fusion-Linux/blob/master/kickstarts/fusion-17/fusion-live-extras.ks
you should specify which temp folder to use when starting
livecd-creator with --temp= option
Hope this helps.
